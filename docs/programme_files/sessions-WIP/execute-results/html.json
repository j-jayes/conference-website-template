i industrialiseringens tidevarv.\n\nThe government over time has played an important role in setting the rules of the game of communication systems by regulation, financing and involvement in infrastructure. As a prerequisite for, and in coevolution with, industrialization and growth infrastructure measures has been one of the core areas of governments' action, from the late 1700s up until today.\n\nThe session will shed light on different areas in the communication and infrastructure field such as the canal era and industrial development, vehicle development in the early era of road transport, the state as an agent spreading modernity through the railway system and the role of Scandinavia’s state-owned air-transport corporation during the cold war. Additional presentations might be added.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Political Economy  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>The political economy of protection</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Political Economy  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Christopher Absell</td>\n<td headers=\"Political Economy  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Recent political events have highlighted the economic importance of the distributional consequences of protection. The United States-China trade war of 2018 and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union have rekindled interest in the impact of politically motivated trade policy interventions on consumer and producer welfare. Outside of a return to unilateralism and protectionism, other forms of non-tariff barriers, such as export subsidies and restrictions, have seen a sharp rise. Across countries and over time, trade policy of differing natures has been used to differing political ends, whether that be favouring domestic, ‘infant’ industry, raising fiscal revenue, or countering foreign, anti-competitive behaviour. Economists and economic historians have shown that the welfare effects of any trade policy, whether liberal or protectionist, generate both winners and losers, and thus may have important long-run distributional consequences that affect the growth and development of a country and its trading partners. What’s more, work on historical episodes of tariff formation have shown that while welfare considerations are frequently central to trade policymaking, distributional choices are sometimes biased by special interest politics. This session seeks to advance the state of the art on the political economy of protection by including work on tariff formation and its consequences for different countries and historical periods.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Political Economy  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>The Neoliberal Shift</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Political Economy  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Jonas Ljungberg and Erik Bengtsson</td>\n<td headers=\"Political Economy  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Half a century ago, textbooks in economics forecasted the continued growth of governments' involvement in the economy along the lines of the mixed economy. By contrast we have seen retreat of government and growth of markets. This session invites papers dealing with different aspects of this shift, from the institutional and economic structure, to economic policy and theory and including sociocultural life.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Political Economy  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>Levels of Cartelization: Scandinavian Perspectives on the Role Cartelization in Business Development</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Political Economy  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Kasper Hage Stjern</td>\n<td headers=\"Political Economy  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Cartels have played an influential role in the history of business in the twentieth century. A cartel is an agreement between firms or organization of firms of the same branch of industry, which is designed to influence production or distribution of goods or services by the limitation of competition. As business leaders grew their businesses from local initiatives to larger regional, national, or even international organizations, many sought to cooperate with their peers in their networks when faced with competition of increasing intensity. Such organizations were permitted, and even encouraged, long into the twentieth century. \nIn this session, we explore the building materials of cartels, both in the sense of the materials produced in the construction and building materials cartels, and in the organizational buildup of cartels that facilitated an inner life of their own as in the brewery industry. We employ a comparative perspective both between countries and between industries to provide new insights into how cartels affected the development of business.</td></tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_group_heading_row\">\n      <th colspan=\"3\" class=\"gt_group_heading\" style=\"background-color: #22458A; color: #FFFFFF;\" scope=\"colgroup\" id=\"Sustainbility\">Sustainbility</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_row_group_first\"><td headers=\"Sustainbility  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>There ain’t no mountain high enough, ain’t no valley low enough: Ownership, redistribution, and extraction of natural resources, 1800-2000</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Sustainbility  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Kasper Hage Stjern</td>\n<td headers=\"Sustainbility  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The demand for natural resources to feed the needs of growing a population and industry has continued to increase since the Industrial Revolution. Technological innovations in transportation and technology have increased the extent and intensity in resource extraction, as well as improving the reach of industrial societies in controlling the access to these resources. These developments, combined with growing state regulatory ambitions in keeping their natural splendor for their own industrial development, as well as popular pressures for democratization and redistribution, have proved a volatile mix. Issues of who owns, extracts, and benefits from, natural resources have been, and still are, important challenges which cause unrest and conflict. This session explores the different dimensions of the ownership, extraction, and redistribution of natural resources from the growing demand for resources since 1800. The participants discuss the topic from overarching perspectives of land reform and resource nationalism, to a closer examination of the experiences of miners’ jobs and regulating the use of mountain ranges.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Sustainbility  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>Sustainability and energy transitions in economic and business history</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Sustainbility  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Mattias Näsman</td>\n<td headers=\"Sustainbility  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The causes of and social and economic consequences of deep structural change are of key interest in economic and business history research. Through three industrial revolutions, sources of energy and their use have been added as inputs for supporting new technological pathways. Fossil fuels such as coal and oil are still dominating global energy mixes following the widespread adoption of coal in the nineteenth century and oil in the twentieth century. Environmental deterioration has followed from increasing global reliance on fossil fuels, where the speed of deterioration massively accelerated after 1950 – a phenomenon now termed the “great acceleration,” posing major challenges for societies at all scales. In recent years, scholars have begun exploring these challenges, asking how to bring about energy and sustainability transitions in order to safeguard against environmental catastrophe. In light of the economic downturn and the energy crisis brought by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the economic consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, EU and US policymakers have implemented policies aiming for the transformation of industries, typically under the heading of a “Green deal.” This session seeks to bring together economic and business history scholars by asking open questions about what our respective fields of research might contribute to the scholarly conversations and policy debates regarding energy and sustainability transitions. How can and, perhaps, should we use history to understand the ongoing transitions? What are the stylized facts from previous transitions? What are the determinants of innovations, and how do innovations contribute to transforming societies? What is the role of large-scale incumbent businesses in transitions? Which headwinds are the transition facing and how could they be overcome? Who will gain and who will lose from a transformed economic structure? The session welcomes contributions answering these and other questions, hoping to highlight and possible identify fruitful economic or business history research agendas.</td></tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_group_heading_row\">\n      <th colspan=\"3\" class=\"gt_group_heading\" style=\"background-color: #22458A; color: #FFFFFF;\" scope=\"colgroup\" id=\"Development\">Development</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_row_group_first\"><td headers=\"Development  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>The role of educational policy, sex education and contraceptives for gender equality</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Development  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Annika Elwert</td>\n<td headers=\"Development  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">In this session, we seek to unite the historical and economic literature on sex education and contraceptives with a special focus on gender equality. Economic inequality between men and women has declined throughout the 20th century in developed countries but is still significant today, despite equal graduation rates, anti-discrimination legislation, and generous family policies. Previous studies have shown the importance of educational policies and the availability of contraceptives for women's educational and career advances. Using that literature as a starting point, we seek to unite the historical and economic literature that uses historical policies (education, childcare, etc.), contraceptive use, and events (e.g., wars, migration flaws) to study the development of gender and economic inequality.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Development  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>Paths towards sustained development in the global south: Historical lessons</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Development  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Erik Green</td>\n<td headers=\"Development  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The Covid 19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have again shown how vulnerable developing countries are to changes in the global economy. After decades of economic growth and reduced poverty many developing countries are again facing severe economic and social challenges. It shows the need to find viable paths toward sustained development in the poor parts of the Global South. This session invites papers that provide historical lessons of sustained and non-sustained paths of economic development in the Global South. The organizers wish to encourage research that explores the influence of historical events, initial conditions and development strategies on past and present development patterns of the catching-up and falling-behind economies. The papers can use a wide range of methods, from detailed case studies to comparative perspectives. Just as the geographic focus is wide, we open up for a broad range of classic economic historian research topics. We, however, especially like to welcome papers dealing with the agricultural transformation and structural change, the role of institutions and factor endowments in economic development, and questions related to the interaction of developing countries with the international economy.</td></tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_group_heading_row\">\n      <th colspan=\"3\" class=\"gt_group_heading\" style=\"background-color: #22458A; color: #FFFFFF;\" scope=\"colgroup\" id=\"Methods and measuring\">Methods and measuring</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_row_group_first\"><td headers=\"Methods and measuring  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>History of economic statistics and measurements</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Daniel Berg</td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The history of macroeconomic indicators, and disputes over calculation methods, is attracting a growing scholarly interest. This touches on more longstanding debates within economic history, such as the evergreen debate on how to best measure and compare long-term changes in living standards and economic growth. The production of key measurements such as GDP and CPI rests on assumptions about the underlying historical context, while not always making much use of qualitative studies on the same contextual factors. Comparing present day goods (or prices) with those of past centuries is a challenging proposition. However, the same challenges can also be the point of departure for fruitful reflection that may inform a wide range of fields within social and economic history.\n\nTaking the emerging field of critical index studies as a point of departure, this session aims to forge new collaborative partnerships between researchers of quantitative and qualitative orientation. We hope to point towards future work of linking old and new measurements, and to discuss how historical universals and equivalences are articulated both within our discipline and in the political use of macroeconomic indicators today.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Methods and measuring  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>History of consumption</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Fia Sundevall</td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">This session welcomes empirical and theoretical contributions to the advancement of research within the field of history of consumption, including but not limited to themes such as consumer culture, consumer groups and segmentation of the consumer market, advertising and marketing, sites of consumption, consumer boycotts and organizations, distribution networks, gift economy, and controversial consumption.\n</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Methods and measuring  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>Central banking – a science or an art?</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Lars Fredrik Øksendal</td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">\nWith inflation returning with a vengeance, monetary policy is at a crossroad. Inflation targeting, the guiding set of beliefs for central banking in most of the advanced world for the last two to three decades, is arguably the most science-based framework for monetary policy decision ever seen. For long lauded by many as the source of low and stable general price patterns, the inflation targeting framework has since 2008 been marred by extremely low policy rates, monetary creation, and asset inflation. And in 2022, consumer prices hit back.\n\nThe reflection of inflation targeting as the most science-based framework rests on two arguments: a) the actual use of economic science and monetary models in the decision-making processes, and equally important b) how all other consideration of the central bank, including financial stability and a well-functioning payments system, became tasks of a secondary nature.\n\nInflation targeting in many ways contrast traditional central banking. Although scientifically informed, central banking always rested on experience and the ability to understand a context as well. Moreover, the need for balancing different concerns, most typically the at times conflicting objectives of monetary and financial stability, traditionally led to trade-offs which emphasised the nature of central banking as that of an art. \nWe believe the timing is right for a session revisiting the fundamentals of how central banking ought to be understood in history as well as in contemporary perceptive.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Methods and measuring  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>Uncovering the Historical Dynamics of Consumer, House, and Property Prices in Sweden</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Rodney Edvinsson</td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">This seminar aims to provide a platform for the presentation and discussion of recent research on the historical evolution of prices in Sweden. The focus of the seminar is on consumer prices, house prices, and property prices, and how these prices have changed over time as a result of economic, social, and political factors.\nThe seminar is an opportunity for economic historians to share their findings, discuss their research methods, and exchange ideas with peers from a range of disciplines. We encourage submissions of papers that provide in-depth analysis of the historical data on consumer prices, house prices, and property prices in Sweden and explore the underlying mechanisms driving price changes. Papers that utilize innovative research methods, such as econometric analysis, archival research, or comparative analysis, are particularly welcome.\nThis seminar promises to be an intellectually stimulating and engaging event for economic historians who are interested in exploring the rich history of prices in Sweden. By bringing together leading experts in the field, we hope to foster collaboration, inspire new research, and deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics of prices in Sweden over time.</td></tr>\n    <tr><td headers=\"Methods and measuring  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>Historical national accounts</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Svante Prado</td>\n<td headers=\"Methods and measuring  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Historical national accounts constitute an important research field within economic history.

Long-run data now covers a very substantial part of the world for the pre-industrial period, and these studies have tremendously increased our understanding of long-term global history as most wage data suggest that there was a relative early “Great Divergence” between north-western Europe on the one hand, and the rest of the world (including the remainder of Europe) on the other (Allen et al. 2011; De Zwart and Lucassen 2020; Lucassen and Seshan 2022)\nThese achievements notwithstanding, there has been growing critique that these studies have put too much weight on the trajectory of incomes of male, urban, unskilled, daily wage labourers and that insufficient attention has been paid to wage differentials between different social groups as well as in what form or manner wages were paid. \nThis session presents papers that are part of a special issue of the International Review of Social History planned for publication in 2024.</td></tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_group_heading_row\">\n      <th colspan=\"3\" class=\"gt_group_heading\" style=\"background-color: #22458A; color: #FFFFFF;\" scope=\"colgroup\" id=\"Living standards, life cycles and ageing\">Living standards, life cycles and ageing</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"gt_row_group_first\"><td headers=\"Living standards, life cycles and ageing  session_name\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\"><div class='gt_from_md'><p>Life cycles incomes and relief during stages of economic hardship</p>\n</div></td>\n<td headers=\"Living standards, life cycles and ageing  organizer\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Anton Svensson</td>\n<td headers=\"Living standards, life cycles and ageing  proposed_session_description\" class=\"gt_row gt_left\">How did individuals overcome economic hardship in different stages of life (e.g. childbearing, widowhood, ageing) in the past?
