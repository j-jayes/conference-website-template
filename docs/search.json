Land argues that the three cities developed large, global networks of maritime commerce and exchange that created tension between merchants and the British Empire which sought to enforce mercantilist policies to constrain American trade to within the British Empire. Colonial merchants created and then expanded their mercantile networks well beyond the confines of the British Empire. This trans-imperial trade (often considered smuggling by British authorities) formed the roots of what became known as the American Revolution."

    "text": "Creating the Cape Colony: The Political Economy of Settler Colonization\nErik Green\nThis open access book offers a detailed study of the foundation and expansion of the Dutch Cape Colony to ask why certain regions in the global south became European settler societies from the 16th century onwards.\nExamining the different factors that led to the creation of the Cape Colony, Erik Green reveals it was a gradual process, made up of ad hoc decisions, in which the agency of indigenous peoples played an important role. He identifies the drivers behind settler expansion, explores the effect of inequality on long-term economic development and examines the relationship between settlers and the colonial authorities, asserting that they should not be treated as one homogenous group with shared economic interests. Assessing specific characteristics of the Cape Colony, such as the proposition it was a slavery economy, and comparing key insights of this study with the historiography of other settler colonies, Creating the Cape Colony demonstrates the need to revise our understanding of how settler economies operated, and to rethink the long-term legacies of settler colonialism."

Kapitalisme, industri og teknologi, was published in August, 2022. It challenges the traditional view of the Industrial Revolution as a short event (1760-1830), which was British, and was driven by a small number of technologies (textiles, steam and the factory). I argue that it was a transition that took a very long time (from around 14/1500), that it was not British but global, and that it was not based on a small set of innovations, but a large number, spread across all economic activity. This leads me to seek an explanation of the industrial transition which was equally wide, and I argue that this was the transition to capitalism - first in agriculture, then manufacture and industry. I identify three drivers: product competition, control of the production process and the development of a capital goods industry."

    "text": "En miljard till svensk musik: Riksdaler och kronor i tjänst hos Musikaliska Akademien under 250 år\nStaffan Albinsson\nKungliga Musikaliska Akademien grundades 1771. Dess barndom var svår trots att det var välbärgade individer ur Stockholms överklass som valdes som medlemmar. En av akademiens legendariska sekreterare konstaterade 25 år senare att akademiens primära syfte då verkar ha varit att anordna ett eget lotteri och att styrelsens roll var att avnjuta ”de goda Måltider, som wankades hos Gumman Noach eller Simsons hwid hwarje Lotteri-Dragning”. Så småningom kom kungliga donationer. Riksdagen började bidra med årliga anslag. Från mitten av 1800-talet har en stor mängd donationer kommit från privatpersoner. Akademien har därför nu att förvalta donationsfonder om sammanlagt runt en miljard kronor. Fondernas urkunder anger de ändamål som akademien måste rätta sig efter.\nUnder runt halvtannat sekel var undervisningen vid konservatoriet akademiens viktigaste uppgift. Därtill kom att bygga upp ett musikbibliotek och senare även ett musikmuseum och ett musikhistoriskt arkiv. Under senare delen av 1900-talet blev dessa fyra verksamheter överförda till statliga myndigheter. Musikaliska Akademien har sedan 1981 ägnat sig åt att föra musiklivets talan i det offentliga, driva angelägna utvecklingsprojekt och fördela medel ur cirka 150 donationsstiftelser.\nEkonomihistorikern Staffan Albinsson beskriver här Kungliga Musikaliska Akademiens 250 år med fokus i hur dess verksamheter utvecklats med hjälp av riksdagens och privatpersoners finansiering."

Many argue that the deregulation of employment protection has been a central precondition for the precarisation of the labour market in many countries. In Sweden, legislative changes were made during the 1990s och 2000s that deregulated agency work and created greater opportunities to use fixed-term employment. Historically, The Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) has had significant influence over the regulations of the Swedish labour market and has organised unions in industries where workers have been affected by precarious employment. Studying LO’s actions and reactions in relation to the liberalisation of employment protection can therefore contribute to understanding the precarisation of the labour market in recent decades. Previous research has largely described LO as a homogeneous actor and taken its’ interests for granted. However, other researchers have noted that whether trade unions act inclusively towards workers with non-standardised employment or not depends on the extent to which they identify common interests with these workers. Therefore, there is a need to gain knowledge about how LO’s interests have been created, what differences have existed between its member unions, and in what ways dominant perspectives have been given priority. The aim of the dissertation is to examine what problem formulations of precarisation and perspectives on solutions at the workplace-, industry- and national level that have shaped LO’s approach to insecure employment and the deregulation of employment protection."

Corporatization was a decades-long, gradual process, starting with formalization in 1911 and its culmination in the early 1990s as the Swedish ‘affärsverk’ (public enterprises) –specific types of “business-like” government authorities– went from being a public agency to being a state-owned enterprise. As such, the corporatization of the ‘affärsverk’ is a key part of this shift towards market orientation.\nThe research presented will be focused around a critical juncture in the historical trajectories of the ‘affärsverk’: The government official inquiry into the public enterprises - the enterprise leadership committee (‘verkledningskommitén’) that was initiated in 1983 and delivered its two final reports in 1985. These reports were then developed into a legislative proposal and accepted in 1987. This proposal officially granted the Affärsverk results-based, corporate governance structures (Berg, 1999). This marked the “last gasp” and a distinct market oriented shift in the organizational and regulatory structure of the ‘affärsverk’, however it did not entail full corporatization.\nBecause of their structure, the affärsverk were part market overseer and regulator, part market actor and part creator of markets. Often acting as both regulator and participant in the very same market. In addition, each of these organizations arose from specific historical circumstances (Waara, 1980). The structures governing ‘affärsverk’ were often unclear and non-uniform.

As such, there was considerable tension between the structures governing the affärsverk and agency in terms of managerial discretion within each affärsverk. It is therefore of interest to bring further understanding to how and to what extent management attempted to utilize this agency to influence their own regulatory structures by partaking in the policy process leading to the major reform in 1987 to this end, verkledningskommittén provides an intriguing subject of study.\nAs an entry point, Berg (1999) explicitly mentions that the internal perspective of the Affärsverk has not yet been covered extensively.

    "text": "This paper is a proposition for a future research project on the role of managerial consultants in the decentralization of Swedish public administration. It draws upon the ongoing research of my thesis which looks at management consultants’ interactions with businesses such as Alfa-Laval and Ericsson in consequential re-organizational projects during the late 1970s and 1980s.

The external chocks have squeezed private capitalists every now and then and forced them to make a restart.

The paper will also show how strategical choices, e.g. holding on to the core business instead of diversifying, are related to their resilience. While many Nordic companies ruled by families rode the wave of restructuring from the United States in the post-war period, continuity in relation to the core business was rarely sacrificed.

Thank you for submitting your session proposals - we’re thrilled to share with you the provisional groupings of the accepted sessions below. 👇\nIf you don’t see a session that aligns with your research interests, don’t worry! You do not need to choose a session when you submit an abstract. Just submit an abstract by March 31st, and we’ll make sure you have a chance to present. 🚀\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Provisional sessions for SEHM23\n    \n    \n      Session groups shown with blue banner\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Session title\n      Organizer\n      Description\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Political Economy💰🏛️\n    \n    Structured by the State – infrastructure and communication in the era of industrialization\n\nBjörn Hasselgren and Jan Ottosson\nSvensk sessionstitel: Staten strukturerar – infrastruktur och kommunikationer i industrialiseringens tidevarv.\n\nThe government over time has played an important role in setting the rules of the game of communication systems by regulation, financing and involvement in infrastructure. As a prerequisite for, and in coevolution with, industrialization and growth infrastructure measures has been one of the core areas of governments' action, from the late 1700s up until today.\n\nThe session will shed light on different areas in the communication and infrastructure field such as the canal era and industrial development, vehicle development in the early era of road transport, the state as an agent spreading modernity through the railway system and the role of Scandinavia’s state-owned air-transport corporation during the cold war. Additional presentations might be added.\n    The political economy of protection\n\nChristopher Absell\nRecent political events have highlighted the economic importance of the distributional consequences of protection. The United States-China trade war of 2018 and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union have rekindled interest in the impact of politically motivated trade policy interventions on consumer and producer welfare. Outside of a return to unilateralism and protectionism, other forms of non-tariff barriers, such as export subsidies and restrictions, have seen a sharp rise. Across countries and over time, trade policy of differing natures has been used to differing political ends, whether that be favouring domestic, ‘infant’ industry, raising fiscal revenue, or countering foreign, anti-competitive behaviour. Economists and economic historians have shown that the welfare effects of any trade policy, whether liberal or protectionist, generate both winners and losers, and thus may have important long-run distributional consequences that affect the growth and development of a country and its trading partners. What’s more, work on historical episodes of tariff formation have shown that while welfare considerations are frequently central to trade policymaking, distributional choices are sometimes biased by special interest politics. This session seeks to advance the state of the art on the political economy of protection by including work on tariff formation and its consequences for different countries and historical periods.\n    The Neoliberal Shift\n\nJonas Ljungberg and Erik Bengtsson\nHalf a century ago, textbooks in economics forecasted the continued growth of governments' involvement in the economy along the lines of the mixed economy. By contrast we have seen retreat of government and growth of markets. This session invites papers dealing with different aspects of this shift, from the institutional and economic structure, to economic policy and theory and including sociocultural life.\n    Levels of Cartelization: Scandinavian Perspectives on the Role Cartelization in Business Development\n\nKasper Hage Stjern\nCartels have played an influential role in the history of business in the twentieth century. A cartel is an agreement between firms or organization of firms of the same branch of industry, which is designed to influence production or distribution of goods or services by the limitation of competition. As business leaders grew their businesses from local initiatives to larger regional, national, or even international organizations, many sought to cooperate with their peers in their networks when faced with competition of increasing intensity. Such organizations were permitted, and even encouraged, long into the twentieth century. \n\n\nIn this session, we explore the building materials of cartels, both in the sense of the materials produced in the construction and building materials cartels, and in the organizational build-up of cartels that facilitated an inner life of their own as in the brewery industry. We employ a comparative perspective both between countries and between industries to provide new insights into how cartels affected the development of business.\n    \n      Methods and measuring📊🧪\n    \n    History of economic statistics and measurements\n\nDaniel Berg\nThe history of macroeconomic indicators, and disputes over calculation methods, is attracting a growing scholarly interest. This touches on more longstanding debates within economic history, such as the evergreen debate on how to best measure and compare long-term changes in living standards and economic growth. The production of key measurements such as GDP and CPI rests on assumptions about the underlying historical context, while not always making much use of qualitative studies on the same contextual factors. Comparing present day goods (or prices) with those of past centuries is a challenging proposition. However, the same challenges can also be the point of departure for fruitful reflection that may inform a wide range of fields within social and economic history.\n\nTaking the emerging field of critical index studies as a point of departure, this session aims to forge new collaborative partnerships between researchers of quantitative and qualitative orientation. We hope to point towards future work of linking old and new measurements, and to discuss how historical universals and equivalences are articulated both within our discipline and in the political use of macroeconomic indicators today.\n    Global inequality – levels and trends\n\nEllen Hillbom\nWhy is inequality higher in some countries than in others? What drives changes in inequality over the long run? These are central questions in economic history; from the pioneering work of Kuznets (1955) to Piketty (2014) and Scheidel (2017). And the scholarly attention to understanding global inequality keeps on growing with influential publications and expanding databases (Milanovic 2018; UNU-WIDER 2023; van Zanden et al. 2014; World Inequality Lab 2023). Yet, there is little consensus on the causes and consequences of global inequality, and because theorizing about inequality is generally inductive, we need more and better empirical studies to understand the evolution of long-term inequality.\nIn this session, we invite papers presenting new data and/or analysing new aspects of dimensions and determinants of long-term inequality, primarily income and wealth. We open up for a broad scope through time and space as we are in search of global commonalities.\n    History of consumption\n\nFia Sundevall\nThis session welcomes empirical and theoretical contributions to the advancement of research within the field of history of consumption, including but not limited to themes such as consumer culture, consumer groups and segmentation of the consumer market, advertising and marketing, sites of consumption, consumer boycotts and organizations, distribution networks, gift economy, and controversial consumption.\n\n\n\n    Central banking – a science or an art?\n\nLars Fredrik Øksendal and Anders Ögren\n\nWith inflation returning with a vengeance, monetary policy is at a crossroad. Inflation targeting, the guiding set of beliefs for central banking in most of the advanced world for the last two to three decades, is arguably the most science-based framework for monetary policy decision ever seen. For long lauded by many as the source of low and stable general price patterns, the inflation targeting framework has since 2008 been marred by extremely low policy rates, monetary creation, and asset inflation. And in 2022, consumer prices hit back.\n\nThe reflection of inflation targeting as the most science-based framework rests on two arguments: a) the actual use of economic science and monetary models in the decision-making processes, and equally important b) how all other consideration of the central bank, including financial stability and a well-functioning payments system, became tasks of a secondary nature.\n\nInflation targeting in many ways contrast traditional central banking. Although scientifically informed, central banking always rested on experience and the ability to understand a context as well. Moreover, the need for balancing different concerns, most typically the at times conflicting objectives of monetary and financial stability, traditionally led to trade-offs which emphasised the nature of central banking as that of an art. \nWe believe the timing is right for a session revisiting the fundamentals of how central banking ought to be understood in history as well as in contemporary perceptive.\n    Uncovering the Historical Dynamics of Consumer, House, and Property Prices in Sweden\n\nRodney Edvinsson\nThis seminar aims to provide a platform for the presentation and discussion of recent research on the historical evolution of prices in Sweden. The focus of the seminar is on consumer prices, house prices, and property prices, and how these prices have changed over time as a result of economic, social, and political factors.\n\n\nThe seminar is an opportunity for economic historians to share their findings, discuss their research methods, and exchange ideas with peers from a range of disciplines. We encourage submissions of papers that provide in-depth analysis of the historical data on consumer prices, house prices, and property prices in Sweden and explore the underlying mechanisms driving price changes. Papers that utilize innovative research methods, such as econometric analysis, archival research, or comparative analysis, are particularly welcome.\n\n\nThis seminar promises to be an intellectually stimulating and engaging event for economic historians who are interested in exploring the rich history of prices in Sweden. By bringing together leading experts in the field, we hope to foster collaboration, inspire new research, and deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics of prices in Sweden over time.\n    Historical national accounts\n\nSvante Prado and Kerstin Enflo\nHistorical national accounts constitute an important research field within economic history. National accounts constitute systematic accounting techniques to measure the economic activity of nations and regions. Internationally, there has been many efforts to extend existing GDP series back to the early modern period and the Middle Ages. Attempts are also made to improve the existing series of nineteenth century early twentieth century. This session welcomes contributions in the field of historical national accounts in a broad sense, for example, on regional national accounts, long-term economic growth, income distribution, environmental accounts, price indices, purchasing power parities, estimates of production in various branches, national wealth, employment, population, satellite national accounts, estimates of unpaid domestic services, human capital formation, and conceptual development.\n    \n      Sustainability🌍🌿\n    \n    There ain’t no mountain high enough, ain’t no valley low enough: Ownership, redistribution, and extraction of natural resources, 1800-2000\n\nKasper Hage Stjern\nThe demand for natural resources to feed the needs of growing a population and industry has continued to increase since the Industrial Revolution. Technological innovations in transportation and technology have increased the extent and intensity in resource extraction, as well as improving the reach of industrial societies in controlling the access to these resources. These developments, combined with growing state regulatory ambitions in keeping their natural splendour for their own industrial development, as well as popular pressures for democratization and redistribution, have proved a volatile mix. Issues of who owns, extracts, and benefits from, natural resources have been, and still are, important challenges which cause unrest and conflict. This session explores the different dimensions of the ownership, extraction, and redistribution of natural resources from the growing demand for resources since 1800. The participants discuss the topic from overarching perspectives of land reform and resource nationalism, to a closer examination of the experiences of miners’ jobs and regulating the use of mountain ranges.\n    Sustainability and energy transitions in economic and business history\n\nMattias Näsman and Josef Taalbi\nThe causes of and social and economic consequences of deep structural change are of key interest in economic and business history research. Through three industrial revolutions, sources of energy and their use have been added as inputs for supporting new technological pathways. Fossil fuels such as coal and oil are still dominating global energy mixes following the widespread adoption of coal in the nineteenth century and oil in the twentieth century. Environmental deterioration has followed from increasing global reliance on fossil fuels, where the speed of deterioration massively accelerated after 1950 – a phenomenon now termed the “great acceleration,” posing major challenges for societies at all scales. In recent years, scholars have begun exploring these challenges, asking how to bring about energy and sustainability transitions in order to safeguard against environmental catastrophe. In light of the economic downturn and the energy crisis brought by the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the economic consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, EU and US policymakers have implemented policies aiming for the transformation of industries, typically under the heading of a “Green deal.” This session seeks to bring together economic and business history scholars by asking open questions about what our respective fields of research might contribute to the scholarly conversations and policy debates regarding energy and sustainability transitions. How can and, perhaps, should we use history to understand the ongoing transitions? What are the stylized facts from previous transitions? What are the determinants of innovations, and how do innovations contribute to transforming societies? What is the role of large-scale incumbent businesses in transitions? Which headwinds are the transition facing and how could they be overcome? Who will gain and who will lose from a transformed economic structure? The session welcomes contributions answering these and other questions, hoping to highlight and possible identify fruitful economic or business history research agendas.\n    \n      Development🌱\n    \n    The role of educational policy, sex education and contraceptives for gender equality\n\nAnnika Elwert and Volha Lazuka\nIn this session, we seek to unite the historical and economic literature on sex education and contraceptives with a special focus on gender equality. Economic inequality between men and women has declined throughout the 20th century in developed countries but is still significant today, despite equal graduation rates, anti-discrimination legislation, and generous family policies. Previous studies have shown the importance of educational policies and the availability of contraceptives for women's educational and career advances. Using that literature as a starting point, we seek to unite the historical and economic literature that uses historical policies (education, childcare, etc.), contraceptive use, and events (e.g., wars, migration flaws) to study the development of gender and economic inequality.\n    Paths towards sustained development in the global south: Historical lessons\n\nErik Green and Ellen Hillbom\nThe ongoing planetary crisis, Covid 19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine have again shown how vulnerable developing countries are to changes in the global economy. After decades of economic growth and reduced poverty many developing countries are again facing severe substantial economic, and social, and environmental challenges. It shows the need to find viable paths toward sustained development in the poor parts of the Global South. This session invites papers that provide historical lessons of sustained and non-sustained paths of economic development in the Global South. \nThe organizers wish to encourage research that explores the influence of historical events, initial conditions and development strategies on past and present development patterns of the catching-up and falling-behind economies. The papers can use a wide range of methods, from detailed case studies to comparative perspectives. Just as the geographic focus is wide, we open up for a broad range of classic economic historian research topics. We, however, especially like to welcome papers dealing with the agricultural transformation and structural change, the role of institutions and factor endowments in economic development, human capital formation and changing labour relations, and questions related to the interaction of developing countries with the international economy.\n    \n      Labour👷\n    \n    Labour, living standards and inequality\n\nErik Bengtsson\nThe study of historical labour, living standards and inequality is at the core of economic history as a field. The purpose of this session, which aims to be a double session, is to collect research on these wider themes on Sweden and other countries, from the early modern period and on to modern eras. We have several papers in the session proposal but also welcome further additions. Discussant duties will be assigned among the presenting authors.\n    Labour and workers in Sweden since approx. 1850\n\nFia Sundevall\nThis session welcomes empirical, theoretical and methodological contributions to the advancement of research within late-modern Swedish labour history, including but not limited to labour coercion, labour migration, employment security, sites of production, labour market intermediaries, labour struggles and unions. We particularly encourage papers which consider and analyse power asymmetries of various kinds.\n\nThe session will be held in English or Swedish, depending on the preferences of paper presenters.\n\n    Labour, Wages and Wage Differentials in Global History, 1500-1950: Special issue: International Review of Social History\n\nKathryn Gary\nThe comparison of wage rates as a way to assess differentials and trends in standard of living across the globe has held centre stage in global social-economic history over the past two decades following the pioneering work of Robert Allen (2001, 2009, 2015). \n\n\nThis work has spurred a large literature gathering and analysing new evidence on wages and prices in order to assess and compare levels and trends in the incomes of the labouring classes in all parts of the world. Long-run data now covers a very substantial part of the world for the pre-industrial period, and these studies have tremendously increased our understanding of long-term global history as most wage data suggest that there was a relative early “Great Divergence” between north-western Europe on the one hand, and the rest of the world (including the remainder of Europe) on the other (Allen et al. 2011; De Zwart and Lucassen 2020; Lucassen and Seshan 2022)\n\n\nThese achievements notwithstanding, there has been growing critique that these studies have put too much weight on the trajectory of incomes of male, urban, unskilled, daily wage labourers and that insufficient attention has been paid to wage differentials between different social groups as well as in what form or manner wages were paid. \n\n\nThis session presents papers that are part of a special issue of the International Review of Social History planned for publication in 2024.\n    \n      Living standards, life cycles and ageing🏠👵\n    \n    Life cycles incomes and relief during stages of economic hardship\n\nAnton Svensson and Louise Cormack\nHow did individuals overcome economic hardship in different stages of life (e.g. childbearing, widowhood, ageing) in the past? This session addresses questions relating to individuals’ economic challenges over the life cycle. Although these challenges are well-known and recognized, deeper understanding of their severity, their consequences and how they have been dealt with historically are needed. This contributes to increased knowledge of how and when welfare policies can aid during life stages of economic hardship, both then and now.\n    The long road to the welfare state... and beyond: retirement, old-age provision and eldercare in the past and present\n\n\nJaco Zuijderduijn and Tobias Karlsson\nBefore the Second World War old men and women relied on support from individuals and families, neighbours and communities, mutual-aid organisations, charities, and commercial organisations. This panel welcomes papers on the various types of retirement patterns, eldercare and provision for old age that existed before the welfare state or in its early phase, for example discussing the importance and reliability of various types of support, their interplay, the pathways from gainful employment to retirement, how and why eldercare was eventually taken over by the state etc. We also welcome papers on old-age provisions that have been developed to complement contemporary welfare states. Our aim is to create an interdisciplinary panel including scholars of economic, social and demography history and other disciplines.\n\n    Pre-Industrial Households and Markets\n\nMarcus Falk\nPresentations of research investigating the pre-industrial household as well as its relation to both local and emerging inter-regional markets. We are looking for presentations of research on diverse topics concerning household reproduction, female and children wage labour participation, living arrangements, inter-household relations, and consumption, aimed at achieving a better understanding of the everyday lives, as well as living standard, of the pre-industrial population.\n    \n      Technological change and migration🚀🛬\n    \n    Historical Perspectives on Migration\n\nJonatan Andersson\nIn this session, papers about internal and international migration in history are presented.\n    Consequences of Technological Change\n\nSuvi Heikkuri\nTechnological change is considered one of the most important factors for modern economic growth. However, the introduction of new technologies often comes with unintended consequences. This session focuses on the consequences of technological change for economic performance at the level of sectors or industries as well as for the labour market. Technological change can be interpreted as an introduction of a new ground-breaking technology or as a broader phenomenon. Potential consequences considered in the session include, but are not limited to, shifts in employment and occupational structure, changes in the demand for skills, and changes in productivity.\n    \n      New PhD projects🎓🆕\n    \n    Up-and-coming research: presentations of new PhD projects in Economic History\n\nFia Sundevall\nWhat doctoral theses in economic history can we expect to read 4-5 years from now? In this session, newly accepted PhD students in Economic history present their doctoral thesis projects."

She is particularly interested in how social institutions, such as guilds and serfdom, have shaped economic development in Europe between the Middle Ages and the present day. Her recent publications have analyzed various aspects of economic history, including communities, the family, gender, human capital investment, consumption, and state capacity.\nKlara Arnberg’s main research interests include the intersection of business history, consumption, gender/sexuality history, and media history, with a specific focus on advertising history and pornography history. Her work is aimed at understanding how these historical contexts shape economic development. We are excited to hear more about her research at the conference."

However, a closer examination of how market actors navigate issues of sexuality and gender can provide valuable insights into how markets are shaped by gender and sexual relations and vice versa. This keynote highlights the significance of economic and business history, using examples from the Swedish pornography and advertising markets, to shed light on this interplay. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of transcending disciplinary boundaries, catering to a broader academic audience."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The expanding research on the evolution of women’s position in society has contributed to dispel persistent myths about how much they contributed to the economic prosperity of developed and developing economies. Scholars have addressed the role of gender and women’s economic activities on economic development (e.g. Boserup, 1970; Goldin, 1990), showing the importance of human capital as key component for the development process (e.g. Diebolt and Perrin, 2013; Baten and de Pleijt, 2021). Although a rich literature has documented the importance of technical and scientific knowledge in the emergence and adoption of innovative industrial technology fostering the industrialization process (Mokyr, 2010; Squicciarini, and Voigtländer, 2015; Cinnirella and Streb, 2017; Mokyr, Sarid, van der Beek, 2019; among others), we lack knowledge on how much women may have contributed to the process. Using a sample drawn from patent and exhibition records for France during the first half of the nineteenth century, Khan (2016) recently showed that entrepreneurship and innovation was not only done by the elites in society but also by middle-class women. During this era women were unable to acquire formal schooling, and it was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that changes in French legislation permitted the establishment of a wider state educational system open to both sexes (Perrin, 2013). Furthermore, while the legal status of women in France was more equal than most other countries in Europe, married women still faced more restrictions than widowed or unmarried women (Lewis, 1980). In this paper, we investigate the evolution of women patenting over time and across space. More specifically, we question the extent to which women participated to the innovation process during the crucial phase of industrialization in France. To this end, we build an original dataset covering patents granted to French women between 1791 and 1899. Despite the absence of scientific and technical education for women, women took an active part in the innovation process. Paradoxically, despite the legal restrictions established by the Civil Code, we find that married women occur more frequently in patent data than widows and unmarried women. The structural changes in human capital investment occurring in the second half of the nineteenth century may have contributed to foster the ability for women to innovate and invent. Substantial regional variation can also be observed across the French territory. The purpose of this study is not only to shed quantitative light on women’s patenting during the whole nineteenth century in France, but also to explore differences in women’s and men’s patenting behavior on a micro-spatial level during the industrialization process. This paper has significance for our understanding of women lives in the past but it has also wider implications, notably to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms behind the development process via the exploration of the links between upper-tail human capital and economic growth."

    "text": "Although women have been actively involved in economic activities throughout the industrialization period (e.g., Boserup, 1970; Goldin, 1990), their contributions to technological progress and innovation activity during this period have yet to be further investigated. Previous studies provided partial evidence that women innovated during the nineteenth century (Chanteux, 2009; Khan, 2016). Women patented in diverse industries and have been involved in patenting activities since the inception of the patenting system in France and throughout the entirety of the nineteenth century (Merouani and Perrin, 2023). Innovation studies have long recognized the role of networks in the innovation process, and are especially useful when analyzed through a dynamic perspective and coupled with geographic information (Boschma and Frenken, 2010). Typically, economic historians have viewed networks related to technological innovation as either structures through which technological innovation diffuses or as links between ideas that define the lineage of innovation (Esteves and Geisler Mesevage, 2019). While there are some studies on the role of social networks in facilitating the process of invention and innovation (e.g., Cook, 2011) – these are few. The existence of a significant and persistent gender patenting gap and a lower propensity for women to patent in teams, as shown by Merouani and Perrin (2023), poses intriguing questions on the role of social networks in innovation. Why are some individuals or networks better connected than others? Does connectivity increase the innovativeness of individuals? What is more important for innovation, connectivity or proximity? But more importantly: To what extent do social networks facilitate or hinder innovation? Although not all innovations are patented, patenting activity as a means of measuring innovation has become a standard practice for making comparisons across time and between countries (Moser, 2016). In this paper, I use a dynamic social network analysis approach with a novel and complete patent dataset of 19th century French patents developed by Merouani and Perrin (2023). Following the work by Moser (2005), I complement this database with other forms of innovations by including innovators acting outside the patenting system by using information from fairs in 19th century France (e.g., Exposition universelle de Paris de 1889). Preliminary findings show that networks of both men and women were especially concentrated in large cities. Networks including female innovators had less connectivity with mediators (e.g., patent agents), which are an integral part of the national network. Further, I find that institutions such as the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers [Conservatory of arts and trades] in Paris acted as large central nodes to attract and develop networks of innovators from all over France. These findings do not include the results of the study’s primary analyses, which are still being conducted."

    "text": "Economic development and inequality are pressing issues in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, home to half of the top 20 most unequal countries in the world. An increasing number of studies are seeking the origins of modern-day inequalities in the colonial period. Moreover, two-sector models by Lewis and Kuznets have been used to explain historical inequality dynamics. These theories postulate that growing inequalities result from the unbalanced distribution of resources between sectors. Yet, these models have two important drawbacks. They neglect the institutional factors influencing inequality outcomes but also cannot account for the complexity and dynamism of societies. Kenya poses an interesting case study as it has been characterized as a dual economy in the pioneering research of income inequality by Bigsten (1987). The conventional understanding is that sectoral dualism together with substantial settler presence would lead to higher levels of inequality. Using primary data collected at the national archives in the United Kingdom and Kenya, this paper produces new estimates of long-run incomes for 28 social classes in Kenya and estimates the inequality between these classes. In doing so, the paper breaks down the different income groups in a more comprehensive manner, especially when it comes to the African smallholder sector. The current study, thus, refers to Bigsten’s work but adds new dimensions to the old analysis by decomposing the social classes to get further insights into racial groups, occupations, skills, and gender differences. The current paper sets out to investigate the levels and trends of income inequality in the colonial setting through the method of constructing social tables. It draws upon the sectoral and institutional theories to interpret these levels and trends of inequality and aims at disentangling which groups gained in relative terms over the period of investigation from 1921 to 1960. In this way, it addresses the two shortcomings of the two-sector models – by adding the institutional dimension and by breaking down the society in a detailed manner using the social tables method. It finds relatively low income inequality in 1921 expressed by a Gini coefficient of 0,34, which contradicts the traditional understanding of the highly polarized nature of settler colonies. The results, then, throw doubt over the dualistic structure of the colony, which had to implement coercive institutional measures in order to secure the supply of labour. The low initial levels of inequality can be explained by low levels of pre-colonial economic development, lack of pre-colonial societal inequality, and the dominance of the smallholder sector living close to subsistence. Towards the end of the colonial period, inequality, however, started increasing and the economy started showcasing signs of dualism although the most oppressive institutional measures were abandoned."

Den första offentliga arbetsförmedlingen öppnades först 1902 i kommunal regi i Halmstad, men icke-offentliga förmedlingar var verksamma under 1800-talet och fortsatte att verka parallellt med den offentliga arbetsförmedlingen fram tills arbetsförmedlingsmonopolets etablering 1942. Exempel på icke-offentliga förmedlingar under tidsperioden i Sverige är kommissionärer, waterschouts, fästekontor, agenter, och diverse föreningars förmedlande verksamheter. De icke-offentliga förmedlingarna var många, små, och specialiserade. Till exempel framkommer det i Riksdagens protokoll att det år 1900 fanns 68 registrerade kommersiella arbetsförmedlare bara i Stockholm. Framför allt var privata förmedlare viktiga för kvinnor som lönearbetade. Dock spelade icke-offentliga förmedlare en betydande roll även för lönearbetsmarknaden som helhet, framför allt i de större städerna. I Lund förmedlades till exempel 49 procent av alla lönearbetare i mitten av 1920-talet fortfarande via icke-offentliga förmedlingar.\nDet är denna icke-offentliga förmedling av arbetare som utgör empiriskt fokus för mitt nyligen påbörjade avhandlingsarbete i ekonomisk historia.

Genom undersökningen om hur arbetsmarknader och arbetarsubjektiviteter skapas genom denna sociala och ekonomiska infrastruktur kommer avhandlingen även att bidra teoretiskt och empiriskt till pågående forskning och diskussion om olika former av förmedling (arbetsförmedling, personaluthyrning och gigarbete) som primärt fokuserat på 1990-talet och framåt.\nEn hypotes är att förmedlare influerade bland annat geografisk plats, typ av arbete och uppgifter samt villkor genom sin förmedlingsaktivitet. I förlängningen innebär det att förmedlarna producerade differentierade lokala arbetsmarknader baserat på bland annat klass, genus, ålder, regional härkomst och etnicitet. Exempel på frågeställningar som jag just nu laborerar med är: Vilka icke-offentliga aktörer förmedlade arbete och arbetare i Sverige från mitten av 1800-talet fram tills arbetsförmedlingsmonopolet instiftades 1942?

Many argue that the deregulation of employment protection has been a central precondition for the precarisation of the labour market in many countries. In Sweden, legislative changes were made during the 1990s och 2000s that deregulated agency work and created greater opportunities to use fixed-term employment. Historically, The Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO) has had significant influence over the regulations of the Swedish labour market and has organised unions in industries where workers have been affected by precarious employment. Studying LO’s actions and reactions in relation to the liberalisation of employment protection can therefore contribute to understanding the precarisation of the labour market in recent decades. Previous research has largely described LO as a homogeneous actor and taken its’ interests for granted. However, other researchers have noted that whether trade unions act inclusively towards workers with non-standardised employment or not depends on the extent to which they identify common interests with these workers. Therefore, there is a need to gain knowledge about how LO’s interests have been created, what differences have existed between its member unions, and in what ways dominant perspectives have been given priority. The aim of the dissertation is to examine what problem formulations of precarisation and perspectives on solutions at the workplace-, industry- and national level that have shaped LO’s approach to insecure employment and the deregulation of employment protection."

    "text": "The rampant growth rate of Swedish GDP per capita from the mid-1850s to 1913, as borne out by early versions of Swedish historical national accounts, has nurtured the notion that the Swedish rise to prosperity was propelled by the confluence of unproportionally high levels of sophistication and very low levels of GDP per capita (Krantz and Nilsson 1975; Sandberg 1978, 1979). The purport of this nexus was captured famously by Sandberg’s (1979) depiction of Sweden as the “impoverished sophisticate”. This view was later supported also by more recent versions of Swedish historical national accounts. Krantz and Schön (2007) showed that Swedish GDP per capita by mid-nineteenth century was 80 percent of the average of Western Europe (excluding the UK and the Netherlands). The image of Swedish mid-nineteenth century backwardness has however been challenged by Edvinsson (2013). The figures of his, in contrast, show a level of Swedish GDP per capita that is equal with western Europe by the mid-nineteenth century. Also, the most recent version of Krantz and Schön (2015), by offering new deflators, has raised the level of Swedish GDP per capita in the nineteenth century relative other countries.\nOne of the most important differences between Edvinsson’s and Krantz and Schön’s versions of Swedish historical national accounts concerns the treatment of home production. In harmony with the recommendations of the System of National Accounts, Edvinsson (2013) include home production before 1950. This is particularly important in the case of Sweden since the grain growing season was very short. As a result of the long off season, home production offered one way of supplementing household incomes in the agricultural sector. Krantz and Schön (2012), despite offering a satellite account on unpaid domestic work, made no systematic attempt to include home production, even though they added it to GDP occasionally to circumvent the shortcomings of the Industrial Statistics (Schön 1988; Bohlin 2003).\nThe great benefit of national accounts is that they can be calculated from output statistics, income statistics or as the sum of private expenditures, public expenditures, and net exports. All previous versions of Swedish historical national accounts have been calculated by the output method, except for parts of services output, which have been estimated from the income side. In this paper, however, we are instead calculating GDP mostly from the income side. Thanks to a parallel project aiming to trace the income distribution from 1860 onwards and using a social tables approach, we have amassed a great deal of information on labour and capital earnings. The information on earnings is based on income taxes and an assortment of complementary sources tracking those below the income threshold for paying taxes. Based on this mass of earnings information, we will construct new estimates of decadal GDP figures between 1870 and 1910. These new estimates will help us to forward our understanding of the growth trajectory and standards of living in Sweden from the mid-nineteenth century to World War I."

    "text": "Economic nationalism has been a crucial aspect of the European economy during late 19th- mid 20th century, especially after the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian war in 1871, and the formation of the French Third Republic and the German Empire, since across the European continent, states are reinforcing their respective economies in order to bolster defense via tariffs, against the world market. The raison d’etre of this paper is to show light into the industrial components and social fabric of France after the Franco-Prussian War, and the subsequent Belle Epoque. The industrial factors being discussed are locomotives of the economy, such as steelworks, mines, and commercial (fleet) sectors. Regarding the socioeconomic fabric of the nation, broad factors, such as GDP growth, governmental spending, and infrastructure will be discussed. Secondly, social oriented factors, such as population growth, education access, disease mortality rates, and employment sectors will be presented, in order to identify the shifts and trends that formed in-between the Second Industrial Revolution and the Great War. Apart from the national developments, European and global data and indexes of the time are available, allowing for multi-leveled comparisons. On the European scale, the abrupt end of a prosperous era will be discussed, whilst on the global scale, the emerging balance between the New and the Old World could be presented.\nFinally, the proposed paper is part of my PhD thesis (1st chapter). The first chapter focuses on the steel industry and social developments in France and Germany during the aforementioned period. The first half of the chapter (regarding Germany) will be presented as a paper in ESSHC 2023, Gothenburg, Sweden."

    "text": "Economic nationalism has been a crucial aspect of the European economy during late 19th- mid 20th century, especially after the conclusion of the Franco-Prussian war in 1871, and the formation of the French Third Republic and the German Empire, since across the European continent, states are reinforcing their respective economies in order to bolster defense via tariffs, against the world market. The raison d’etre of this paper is to show light into the industrial components and social fabric of France after the Franco-Prussian War, and the subsequent Belle Epoque. The industrial factors being discussed are locomotives of the economy, such as steelworks, mines, and commercial (fleet) sectors. Regarding the socioeconomic fabric of the nation, broad factors, such as GDP growth, governmental spending, and infrastructure will be discussed. Secondly, social oriented factors, such as population growth, education access, disease mortality rates, and employment sectors will be presented, in order to identify the shifts and trends that formed in-between the Second Industrial Revolution and the Great War. Apart from the national developments, European and global data and indexes of the time are available, allowing for multi-leveled comparisons. On the European scale, the abrupt end of a prosperous era will be discussed, whilst on the global scale, the emerging balance between the New and the Old World could be presented.\nFinally, the proposed paper is part of my PhD thesis (1st chapter). The first chapter focuses on the steel industry and social developments in France and Germany during the aforementioned period. The first half of the chapter (regarding Germany) will be presented as a paper in ESSHC 2023, Gothenburg, Sweden."

Female inventors are found to be more likely to co-invent, both as independent inventors, as well as with patents where a company is the patent holder.

    "text": "Apocalypse Now, the Bank of England circulated an internal report to member central banks of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in 1979. Prepared for ‘possible consequences of a debt service failure by a major borrowing country’, it warned of the growing indebtedness of less-developing-countries and lending practices of international banks. Some of the central bankers had called for the supervision of the Eurocurrency market, an offshore market for major currencies as well as a key channel for the recycling of petrodollars since the mid-1970s, against the threat of instabilities in the global financial market. However, the international financial organisation failed to prevent the much-prophesied crisis – the Latin American Debt Crisis of 1982. Two years later, the Eurocurrency Standing Committee, a specialist organisation of the BIS to tackle the growing debt burden of emerging markets, expressed a sense of frustration about the results of its work since 1980. This paper analyses the unsuccessful initiative by monetary authorities and international financial organisations to tackle the debt crisis and the governance of global finance before and after the Latin Debt Crisis of 1982. It contends that the economic sovereignty of nation-states and the offshore markets in the Global South was the key to understand the failure of synchronisation of national policies on the debt crisis. First, it examines key issues regarding the stateless market. The collection of consolidated statistics of Eurocurrency borrowings was the very first step towards the formulation of a regulatory framework. The BIS sought to set standard rules of prudential banking to prevent excessive lending operations and their macroeconomic ramification. And the assumption of lender of last resort by central banks compatible with the global expansion of the Eurocurrency market a contingent measure. However, national interests were prioritised than a global solution owing to diverged understandings of the market; hence, the lessons of the 1982 crisis was dismissed, which left the regulation of the global market at national levels. Second, this paper suggests that offshore markets around the world frustrated efforts by central banks of developed countries, including the United States, to formulate a comprehensive regulation of the global financial market. These global entities under the national jurisdiction were able to deliberately avoid the approach by the BIS to collect banking data. Instead, the competitive pressure in international banking business led to the establishment of the International Banking Facility in New York to further facilitate Eurocurrency lendings. This paper concludes that the incompatibility of the inter-state solution to the global Eurocurrency market and the cardinal element in the governance of global finance in the 1980s – the economic sovereignty of nation-states. It extensively uses original documents from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Bank of England, and the UK government and contemporary periodicals such as Euromoney."

    "text": "The study of historical income inequality in sub-Saharan Africa has received considerable attention over recent years, driven by the increasing recognition of the importance of economic inequality and colonial legacies for long-run economic development. Several studies have utilised the social tables approach to estimate inequality levels and trends in several different colonies (Aboagye & Bolt 2021; Bolt & Hillbom 2016; de Haas 2021; Tadei & Alfani 2019). This paper contributes to this literature with a case study on colonial Tanzania (Tanganyika). Tanzania today has one of the lowest levels of income inequality in sub-Saharan Africa, and its post-colonial history shows a level of political stability rarely seen on the continent. How this was achieved remains unclear. Despite being one of the most-studied countries in contemporary African studies, Tanzania’s colonial economic history has received comparatively little attention. To shed light on the levels and trends in income inequality on Tanganyika as well as their drivers, this paper estimates a series of Gini coefficients and inequality extraction ratios by creating social tables for five benchmark years between 1925 and 1948 as well as annual social tables for 1949 to 1957. The results show that overall, inequality as measured by the gini coefficient was relatively low throughout the colonial period and declining towards the end. The gini coefficients, however, do not adequately highlight pronounced racial inequalities that existed in both the wage sector as well as amongst agricultural producers. Racial inequalities were, however, declining throughout the colonial period as well, driven by the Africanisation of both the wage sector and agricultural export production. While this led to declining racial inequality, it also led to greater within-African inequality, driven by an increasing share of skilled labourers in the wage sector and increasing regional differentiation in African agricultural production. Looking at the gini coefficients in relation to the maximum attainable inequality – the inequality extraction ratio – confirms the impression of relatively high inequality throughout the colonial period, with a decline towards the end. The main drivers of inequality in colonial Tanzania, then, are identified as racial wage and employment discrimination and uneven agricultural development. Colonial policies played a significant role in both. In the wage sector, they established formal and informal colour bars and explicit wage discrimination, which suppressed African incomes and limited African income earning opportunities overall. This was exacerbated by a failed educational strategy which did not offer enough education to create a skilled labour force that could meet the demands of the Tanganyikan economy. In the agricultural sector, it was the colonial administration’s focus on promoting African cash crop production in already well-performing areas and the failure to improve market access in remote areas which led to an increasing regional gulf in incomes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Associated to the proliferation of platform capitalism, a strand of management and organisational literature came to attach to this development a theory of institutional entrepreneurship, and ascribed to the entrepreneurs the power to drive institutional change. Typically, Uber has been the platform in focus, and the way that the company managed to curb legislation and bend institutions governing labour markets for taxi drivers has been the empirical material to back it up. The conflict is described as one against institutional inertia, and the theory attempt to capture the process in which ‘embedded’ actors resist, and finally give in, to divergence.\nTwo things is underemphasised in this strand of theory, and in research of the platform economy more broadly.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Associated to the proliferation of platform capitalism, a strand of management and organisational literature came to attach to this development a theory of institutional entrepreneurship, and ascribed to the entrepreneurs the power to drive institutional change. Typically, Uber has been the platform in focus, and the way that the company managed to curb legislation and bend institutions governing labour markets for taxi drivers has been the empirical material to back it up. The conflict is described as one against institutional inertia, and the theory attempt to capture the process in which ‘embedded’ actors resist, and finally give in, to divergence.\nTwo things is underemphasised in this strand of theory, and in research of the platform economy more broadly. The first is the role of the state in the implementation of its markets.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The dissolution of the Yugoslavian state and the formation of independent republics in the beginning of the 1990s, lead to a change in both formal institutions (laws, rules etc.) as well as informal institutions (norms, values etc.). As institutions are omitted and bounded by, as well as depending on, the nation state (see e.g., Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012; Olsen 1996), major changes in the nation state influence changes in the institutional framework. The aim of this article is to investigate how changing values on sexual behaviour and changing formal institutions have coincided. For this we use data from World Values Survey (WVS) for Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia 1995 and 2020. The research questions are:\n\nIn what way have values on sexual behaviour developed differently in Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia?\nHow have the change in values coincided with change in legislation in the three countries?\nHow have increasing religiousness and the role of the church coincided with changing values on sexual behaviours?\n\nUsing individual WVS-data, we estimate values on homosexuality, abortion, divorce in a logit regression, using religiousness, country, age, education and gender as explanatory variables. We find major differences in the development of the three countries. While Slovenia developed towards a more accepting society with a higher share of respondents finding the measured sexual behaviours justifiable, Croatia and Serbia developed the other way around. The share of respondents finding these sexual behaviours never justifiable have increased considerably in Croatia and Serbia, while they have decreased in Slovenia. The values on sexual behaviours are correlated with religiousness, and we find a positive correlation between “never justifiable” and religiousness. However, even though religiousness has increased in Croatia and Serbia, it cannot fully explain the change. A significant component remains connected to the nation state that drives us to the conclusion that this is specifically connected to change in formal institutions. These changes in formal institutions (i.e., legislation) we qualitatively and descriptively connect the changes in values. Notably, Slovenia has run a different policy, than Croatia and Serbia."

    "text": "In this paper, we study the migration patterns to and from the technical secondary school in Hänösand and the subsequent technical high school from 1901 to 1971, when an educational reform included the school in the new upper secondary school system. The purpose is to understand how a peripheral technical educational institution functioned as a “magnet” of technical studies for the northern regional youth and a provider of educated technicians to a peripheral but developing labour market in the first half of the 20th century.\nIn light of emerging mid-19th-century industrialisation, Sweden established so-called technical secondary schools (tekniska elementarskolor) in four cities in the southern and central parts of the country. However, discussions about including the Swedish north in this net of intermediate-level technical educational institutions had already begun. Nevertheless, it was only in 1901 that the Parliament decided to establish a similar school in Härnösand. A technical high school (tekniskt gymnasium) replaced the technical secondary school in 1920. We interpret this establishment in the light of the contemporary view of northern Sweden as an industrial “Future Country”. The emerging industrial development in the north of Sweden implied that the Härnösand-based school’s primary purposes were to provide technical education for northern youngsters, who were to serve in northern Sweden upon graduation. Today, visions again point out the Swedish north as an industrial “Future Country” destined to take the lead in the so-called green transition. Sweden’s northernmost country, Norrbotten, envisions around 100.000 new inhabitants in the years to come, whereas Skellefteå municipality in neighbouring Västerbotten aims to increase its population by 25.000 by 2040. The present-day northern regions demand, foremost, educated people. In light of these visions, we consider it essential to study how investments in northern Sweden fell out during earlier periods and how the peripheral region managed to attract and retain an educated workforce"

This especially applies to the great merchant houses the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries such as Barings, Morgan, and Rothschild. Indeed, these banks played a crucial (yet volatile) role in creating and sustaining the early-modern and modern financial system that first spanned much of Europe and later the globe. Research concerning merchant banks has until recently been dominated by studies that portray these banks as homogenous economic actors, or even pure financial institutions. Human agents affiliated with the merchant banks, from individual partners to clerks, but also merchants’ wives and relatives from the extended family, have consequently received less to no attention. These characters seem to only become relevant once they directly serve the continuation or success of the company.

In other words, how autonomous was a household from its merchant bank, and did the household perform any key financial functions in tandem with or separately from the bank? In this paper, I intend to re-centre the household in the study of the merchant bank by examining how the Scots-Dutch merchant bank Hope & Co. related to its partners’ household(s) between ca 1730 and 1830. This period of approximately a century witnessed great social, economic, political, and technological changes that profoundly affected the role and behaviour of merchant houses. Given these far-reaching changes, it is worthwhile studying now only how the household related to the merchant bank, but also how the household(s) of Hope & Co. developed alongside the company. The case of Hope & Co. can reveal the hitherto unexplored relationship between merchant banks and the “private”, “familial” household, and shed light on how these entangled entities performed multiple, sometimes overlapping financial and non-financial functions. The household is here defined as the immediate physical residence that (initially) also housed the merchant bank, but the analysis will also include the financial entanglements of the partners who had their own, separate households—belonging to the “extended” family and the kinship network, whose lives and finances were all interconnected. I hypothesise that, over the course of the nineteenth century, once familial partners died and heirs forfeited a future in the business, the “household” of the merchant bank and the “household” of the family became separate entities with different financial priorities and behaviour. This, I argue, explains why the household was initially weft into the finances of the merchant bank, but would be severed from the merchant bank once partners from “outside” took over and the merchant bank “professionalised”."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper examines the impact of forced migration on economic and political development in the short and long term. For the first time, I use data on the ethno-religious composition of municipalities in inter-war Poland and examine the total expulsion of more than 600,000 Ukrainians and other minorities not recognized as Poles from south-eastern Polish territories after the establishment of the current Polish borders between 1944 and 1947. The study finds a long-lasting negative effect of deportation on labor market outcomes such as unemployment, however, this effect declines in importance between 1990 and 2020. The findings further suggest that one of the important mechanisms behind this effect is the increased intensity of collective farming in the areas that experienced forced migration. To investigate this further, I combine data sets from three time periods: Pre-deportation data from the interbellum period (1921-1939), data from the socialist period (1944-1989), and modern data (1990-2020). For this purpose, I vectorized a historical administrative map of municipalities from the interwar period, which allows me to assign interwar census data (1921 and 1931) to modern municipalities by intersecting historical and modern municipalities. To my knowledge, this has not been attempted before. In addition, I take data at the municipal level from statistical yearbooks of the 1980s and manually adjust them to today’s municipalities. This results in a novel dataset that combines 100 years of municipality level data for the provinces of Lublin, Subcarpathia and Lesser Poland, covering 555 contemporary municipalities. This procedure can also be applied to the other territories of present-day Poland that were part of the Second Polish Republic (1919-1939). The territories are then separated by a line that follows the so-called ‘Ukrainian Ethnic Territory’ (UET), i.e., the territory with a significant (&gt;10%) minority of Ukrainians and other ethnic minorities. This is then being used to show that other potential confounders vary smoothly around the UET and allows to identify how municipalities that experienced deportations performed relative to similar unaffected municipalities. The fuzzy RDD approach used for this analysis allows viewing deportation as discontinuous rather than binary, considering that municipalities outside the UET also experienced small amounts of deportation. This paper will complement the previous literature in several ways: First, it examines the long-term effects of deporting a population group with lower socio-economic and educational performance, whereas most of the previous literature has focused on the opposite. Second, the study identifies the strengthening of state institutions as another important mechanism determining the legacies of deportation. In the Polish context, the state took advantage of the property rights vacuum after the deportations to expand collectivized agriculture, something that was hardly possible in other parts of the country belonging to the Second Polish Republic, where deportations did not take place. Finally, the study shows that while the effect persists for some variables in the long run, it weakens or even disappears over time."

In the Polish context, the state took advantage of the property rights vacuum after the deportations to expand collectivized agriculture, something that was hardly possible in other parts of the country belonging to the Second Polish Republic, where deportations did not take place. Finally, the study shows that while the effect persists for some variables in the long run, it weakens or even disappears over time."

    "text": "This paper deals with the Frontline Christmas Gift – Fältjulklappen – in Sweden during the Second World War. The annual campaign was organized by a national committee in which commercial actors, the military, and non-profit organizations joined forces to market home front patriotism by sending gifts to all soldiers and auxiliary service staff on duty on Christmas Eve. It was directed at civilians (primarily women) from the end of November to mid-December each year 1940-1944, and the presents were distributed by the military, with the help of female auxiliary corps, to deployed (male) soldiers and other military staff on guard (also primarily male, but some women too). Ultimately, 400 000 such gifts were delivered over the course of the war, as the campaigns successfully mobilized the resources of consumer society (advertising, shop windows, sales clerks), traditional gender roles (the devoted/protected woman in the service of her male guardian), and the commercial potential of patriotism and idealism. Drawing on archival documents (including correspondence, newspaper clippings, protocols, reports and the like) from the Frontline Christmas Gift national committee, this paper explores how established practices associated with consumer society and heterosexualized gender norms were both preserved and adapted during a period of significant upheaval through a national ritual of collective gift-giving. The gifts, we argue monetized a specific notion of (female) obligations and (male) “needs”, and thereby sought to boost the nation’s morale while at the same embedding it in Swedish consumer society."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper examines the health effects of labor strikes in Sweden during the early 20th century. Worker-employer disagreements over wages and working conditions often resulted in work stoppages in the form of strikes, and Sweden experienced a significant number of strikes during this period, making it one of the world’s leaders in industrial disputes [Korpi and Shalev, 1979]. By studying the health impacts of these strikes, this research aims to shed light on the consequences of labor disputes for workers and their families. While strikes are a common form of labor dispute, limited research has been conducted about their potential health effects. Specifically, this study investigates whether strikes led to changes in mortality measures. To estimate the causal effect of strikes on health, this study uses a unique historical quasi-experiment: the staggered adoption of strikes across Sweden between 1908 and 1927. I exploit the time-parish variation of the strikes and estimate staggered difference-in-differences models and event studies. The identification strategy relies on the exogenous variation of the time of the strike, assuming that the exact date of the strike is exogenous and not influenced by the mortality patterns in the parish. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the validity of the identification strategy. This study contributes to the literature on the relationship between strikes and health by examining strikes across various work sectors, in contrast to previous studies that focused exclusively on transportation or healthcare sectors [Gruber and Kleiner, 2012; Adda, 2016; Bauernschuster et al., 2017; Karlsson and Schwarz, 2021; Hirani et al., 2022; Costa, 2022; Friedman et al., 2022]. The research uses administrative reports to identify the strikes, which provide rich background information on the exact date, place, and causes of the strikes [Enflo and Karlsson, 2019; Molinder et al., 2021, 2022]. Mortality measures are derived from administrative sources that cover the entire population. In addition, digitized individual-level death certificates from 1918 to 1920 with cause-of-death are used. The study also uses linked data from the 1900 and 1910 Censuses to provide information on important demographic and socioeconomic indicators. The study finds that strikes during the Great Influenza Pandemic increased the mortality rate in the subsequent weeks. Compared to a baseline weekly mortality rate of 0.3 per 1,000 population, strikes during the pandemic resulted in a 16 percent increase in the weekly mortality rate, which translates to an estimated 750 additional deaths over the course of the pandemic. This finding is driven by influenza-related deaths among the workers. The study finds that these effects emerged in areas without containment measures (such as gathering bans) in place, providing support for the idea that the mass gatherings associated with the strikes propagated respiratory disease transmission. However, strikes outside of periods of elevated disease prevalence do not appear to have a significant effect on mortality. By examining the health effects of labor strikes in Sweden during the early 20th century, this study makes a novel contribution to our understanding of the complex relationship between employment and health."

    "text": "Moderate advertising The historical development of the regulation of alcohol advertising in Sweden 1950–2003 The study investigates the historical development of the regulation of alcohol advertising in Sweden during the period 1950–2003. It centers on how central stakeholders (companies, business associations, temperance movement, consumer and state representatives) promoted their interests in the policy process of alcohol advertising regulation. The period contains central discussions about how alcohol and alcohol advertising should be regulated, and subsequent rule changes and institutional development both within legislation and self-regulation of alcohol advertising. Unlike most products on the competitive consumer market, which can be advertise freely to compete and increase market shares, advertising for alcohol is constrained by wider public considerations of its inherent adverse effects. This sets the scene for a complicated policy process of regulation, with a diverse group of stake holders vying for influence. The topic has not been previously investigated, and even on an international level, historical studies of regulatory development for alcohol advertising are few. This analysis will consequently make an important contribution to regulatory studies and advertising history.\nThe starting point of the period is linked to the emergence of a more liberalized consumer market after the abolition of the “motboken” rationing system in 1955. This put the regulation of alcohol advertising in focus, primarily due to fears that advertising would promote overconsumption, causing negative social effects and deteriorating public health. Advertising was therefore discussed and assessed in relation to promoting either a moderate consumption or as public health hazard that had to be banned. By the end of the 1970s, a very strict statutory regulation was implemented, in effect creating a ban on alcohol advertising. The end point is in turn linked to a liberalization of alcohol advertising in the wake of Sweden’s entry into the EU. This culminated when the ban on alcohol advertising was ruled as counter to EU regulation by Swedish courts, in effect introducing new legislation in 2003 that permitted advertising of wine and beer in the press.\nPrevious research on the general development of Swedish advertising regulation during the 1950s and 1960s has shown that the development was not self-evident, but dependent on the strategic actions of key stakeholders (Funke, 2015). A cursory study of sources indicates a similar policy process with regards to alcohol regulation: changes did not follow a pre-determined trajectory, instead, the policy process exhibits several signs of key stakeholders trying to impose their opposing interests, causing it to develop in an unpredictable manner. The role of self-regulation also seems important in overall regulatory development, although its influence appears to vary over time. The design of the study is therefore based on these conclusions about the importance of agents in regulatory development, and the interaction between self- and statutory regulation. Michael Funke Ph.

    "text": "The climate crisis and other environmental problems pose major challenges to contemporary societies, even existential risks. Effective mitigation of climate change as well as other environmental problems will require transformations of social and technological (socio-technical) systems (Khöler et al 2019). While scholarship in various social scientific disciplines including economic and environmental history as well as the history of technology have began studying the drivers, challenges and complexities relating to environmental and energy transitions, business history has thus far overlooked these topics (e.g. Taalbi 2019, Van der Vleuten 2020, Miller and Warde 2019). This proposed paper has a dual purpose: it proposes a transition research agenda for business history research while providing a case study of the Swedish car industry’s political activities during the energy crisis, aiming at delaying regulatory driven environmental adaption of passenger cars. Business history scholarship have a lot to offer in understanding present-day transitions, not least regarding the role of big business in shaping the rules governing the transition (Bergquist and David 2022) and the role of incumbent industries in directing investments deciding future “sustainable” technologies and their development (Newell, Geels and Sovacool 2022). I believe that an exploration of the Swedish automobile industry’s political activities during the oil crises are particularly illuminating for this purpose. The target period bears many similarities with the present, where Western political and business systems were facing ‘polycrisis’ – multiple crises spanning the environment, the breakdown of the Fordist production regime, as well as crises in energy, economic and monetary systems (Zeitlin, Nicoli and Laffan 2019). The paper shows that Swedish carmakers Volvo and Saab, despite being global leaders in complying with stringent emission standards on the US market, heavily objected to implementing stringent emission requirements and introducing advanced emission control technologies in Sweden, while showing how these objections related to crises in the European economy. The paper draws from state archives as well as the library of the Swedish Automobile Industry Association (Bilindustriföreningen) to highlight how the Swedish industry employed several different strategies to exercise power in order to convince or force the, in a European context, very proactive Swedish government to lessen its ambitions on exhaust emission control regulation. Thus, the paper aims at contributing to scholarly debates regarding power in governing transitions while aiming to shed historical light on the present transition of the vehicle fleet toward zero emission vehicles."

    "text": "It is well known among historians of the north-west European early modern household that the life\u0002cycle stage of the household has a large impact on the possible income of the household. However, the actual impact of household life-cycle stage on consumption and household material living standards remains somewhat elusive. Utilizing the extensive, and often comprehensive, collection of probate material available for the early modern period allows us an opportunity to at least identify broad trends. Though probate records, at least for Sweden, consistently lacks the age at death; by linking these individuals to parish registers in which this information exists, or utilizing a proxy based on the relative legal age of the children of the deceased when this is unavailable, we can effectively locate probated households within the household life cycle. With a large enough sample, we should be able to not only analyze the possible impact that household age had on household consumption, based on the goods owned by the household, but also whether this changed in any significant way over the course of the early modern period. Based on recent research on household life-cycle economics, the income potential of households over the life cycle should follow an inverted U-shaped curve: Starting low for young families, increasing as children get older and can start contributing labour to the household, and then decrease again as children move out and the household heads get older (Horell et al. 2021). It is less known, however, how, more specifically, these life cycle shifts in income would affect the material conditions of the household. Life-cycle servanthood before starting a household together with the ability to compensate for missing labour potential through the hiring of servants, both common among the predominantly rural population of the early modern period, would have worked to counteract the lower incomes during the early and late stages in the household life cycle (de Vries 2008; Lindström 2008). Utilizing the available probate data, we should be able to get to the bottom of this, and identify possible correlations between the material conditions of the household and their life-cycle stage"

    "text": "During the Age of Mass Migration (1860-1930), over a million Swedes migrated to the US, with a little over 40% of them being women. While recent advances in digitization and record-linking techniques have allowed researchers to explore different migration dynamics using longitudinal micro-level data, female migration is often missing from these studies due to challenges in linking women across data sources. This is because women changed their last names after marriage and their occupations were often underreported. While economic incentives have been attributed as the main driver for migration, the experience of female migrants was different from that of men due to various factors such as their reliance on migrant networks, limited available occupations, and reluctance to upgrade their occupation in the US. In this paper, I stress the importance of understanding the unique experiences of female migration and explore the occupational trajectories of Swedish women in either the US or Sweden during the period 1886-1910. Specifically, I investigate whether migrant women were less likely to experience occupational changes than stayers, using data from Swedish and US censuses (1890-1910), and the Swedish Emigrant Register (1886-1910). To address the challenges of linking women across data sources, I restrict our analysis to unmarried men and women upon entry into the labor market. I use probabilistic matching methods like the ABE-JW algorithm to link men and women across data sources and to reduce bias introduced by migrant selection, I compare migrant-stayer immigrants coming from the same parish to account for unobserved parish heterogeneity. I expect to find that migrant women were less likely to change their occupations compared to stayers, particularly due to Sweden’s rapid industrialization during this period. By emphasizing the importance of understanding female migration experiences, this paper contributes to the broader literature on migration and gender."

In this paper we will show how Skånska Cement, that was the original company, built the company and increased the market shares during the 1900th century especially for products further up in the product chain. The strategy of the company was for a long time to increase the use of cement by increasing and expanding the use of concrete products. In the 1970s the compa-ny dominated the Swedish market for several building materials and when the main company merged with the competing cement company, Gullhögen, it had reached monopoly for several products.\nIn the paper we follow how different building materials were integrated into the company’s scope and how the company collaborated with companies in other countries in different ways to restrict the competition. One of the main strategies that Skånska Cement used to grow their company with, was to set up affiliated companies for new products. In the affiliated companies’ foreign owners (that owned the patent or had developed the product) became co-owners. The affiliated companies were often set up so that they produced and sold one product, and in connection to the set up the compa-nies set up cartel agreements for their domestic markets and for the markets that they sold the prod-uct on. In this way the product-company also became the core for the cartelization of the product. The companies that co-owned the product-company could also link the restriction of competition to other markets and cartels that they were engaged in. With a diversity of products, the large companies could make sure that their products were favoured on the construction sites and in the large purchase programmes. Collaboration was a clear strategy for the growth and formation of the cement group, but the scale, scope, content and boarder of the cooperation varied.\nIn the paper material from different companies that produced building materials and were connected to the Skånska Cement (later Cementa) and Skånska Cementgjuteriet (later Skanska) will be used to study the introduction and the development of the products and the company on the Swedish market.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The conclusion of the GATT Tokyo Round in 1979 marked a turning point for the international trade regime. Prior to the Tokyo Round, global trade institutions were shaped by two partially conflicting principles established in the aftermath of WWII. These principles included open or ‘free’ international trade in goods and services, and the freedom for states to enhance their welfare provision and regulate their economies to reduce unemployment. As suggested by previous research, the Tokyo Round shifted the relative dominance of these principles, ushering in a period of at least three decades during which a ‘purer’ form of economic liberalism became the more dominant ideology in international trade governance (Lang 2011). This shift has been referred to as the transition from an ‘embedded’, to a ‘redisembedded’, or ‘neo-’, liberalism (Ruggie 1997).\nDuring the same period, there has been a trend towards increasingly deep and comprehensive trade agreements with a growing scope and ambition (Dür et al 2012). These agreements now typically address not only tariff levels but also so-called non-tariff barriers, such as import quotas, subsidies, and technical barriers in the form of rules and regulations. Negotiations have also focused on whether trade agreements should be widened to include provisions on labor standards, or not.\nTo fully comprehend the development of international trade, it is crucial to examine how trade interests are shaped in relation to the shifting and increasingly complex trade landscape. This involves understanding the formation of trade interests not only at the state level but also through and within specific interest groups. This paper examines the articulation and internal struggles of trade union interests within the Swedish trade union confederation (Landsorganisationen; LO) in relation to the changing international trade landscape and the principles of economic liberalism and state welfare provision. Using organizational materials from LO and its member unions, the study focuses on two pivotal moments in union discussions on trade: the early 1980s LO ‘Economic policy for the 80s’ report and the mid-2010s TTIP and CETA trade agreements negotiations."

However, after leaving gold standard, Riksbank started to be cautious in expanding money supply unless in urgent need of bailout.2) The rising in the deposit reserve ratio of banks offset the expansionary monetary policies and thus the actual money circulated in the market was even in contraction in most of the time under the study. 3)The reserve and currency value, instead of domestic monetary demand, were the main goals of monetary policies after leaving gold standard."

The industrial transition led to continuous economic growth, and to the ecological crises we are now experiencing. However, there is still confusion about what this revolutionary process in fact was, and how it happened. This transition has traditionally been understood as an Industrial Revolution - a British event which took place approximately between 1760 and 1830, driven by mechanized textile factories and steam power, and later emulated elsewhere. I argue against this view and present an alternative. I argue that growth started much earlier (from around 1400); that innovation took place across the economy (and accelerating from around 1700), and that it was a part of a global restructuring. If technological change took place across the whole economy we need a wide, society-encompassing explanation. I argue that we must bring capitalism back into the history of industrialization. I focus on three drivers which both fostered and forced innovation, namely firm-level technological competition in products, capitalists’ control of the work process within the business, and the development of competitive firms within a specialized machine making industry. Such a perspective means that the industrial transition becomes extended in time and broadened in geographical reach. It was a European process, which again was linked to global changes, which included the growth of the Atlantic system, imports of Asian goods to Europe, and global competition in the west-African slave market, from around 1600."

I exploit rich data on pill sales across markets and time to characterize how Swedish teens’ access to pharmacies shaped pill use and fertility after the pill’s introduction. Pill sales are highly sensitive to pharmacy access, and teen fertility responds strongly to pill sales. The unique data establish an important link in the causal chain from pill access to women’s fertility. Estimated fertility responses to the pill could explain the halving of teen births after the pill’s introduction, a finding which is robust to accounting for trends in female education, abortion provision, and other factors."

    "text": "We present the initial dataset of a five year research project with a focus on three different perspectives on spinners and industrialization. The first study focuses on the role of the state by returning to a classic debate in Swedish historiography. What role did manufacturies play in the Swedish process of industrialization? In the second sub-study we will investigate to what extent we can uncover a Swedish industrious revolution. The third sub-study focuses on the role of spinners’ wages, both as a potential driver of labour- saving capital investment by early industrialists and as a measure of both household and individual income. Altogether, the project looks at the impact of paid spinning from the individual to the national level, highlighting the role of women’s work in early modern Swedish economic development. Our primary data consist of lists of the workers employed by spinning privilege holders. These privileges were something of a hold-over from Sweden’s state-led manufactory system – while many manufactories closed after a policy change in the 1760s, wool cloth production remained in operation, and spinning was a continued priority. All spinning in the manufactory system – and so the vast majority of paid spinning – was regulated under the “spinning privileges” and recorded in this material. This material is unique in including detailed biographical information about individual workers, such as names, ages, and male family members’ occupations, as well as detailed information about wages and productivity.\nInitial findings indicate that the state responded to the labor needs of different communities by ‘planting’ female-oriented jobs in areas dominated by male-only industries such as mining. While evidence of a ‘pure’ industrial revolution is lacking, there is some indication that adoption of cotton, a fairly new and globally-oriented textile, could have been a result of industrious behaviors. Measures of individual production and age-based wage profiles shows a life-cycle pattern: younger women focused on more highly-paid fine spinning, while older women spun more fiber by weight, but into courser thread. This helped even out age earning profiles along the life course after a peak in early adulthood."

Researchers have highlighted factors such as market conditions, types of goods produced, barriers to entry, and the problem of dissuading cheating through trust. However, a recurring issue has been the lack, or small extent, of surviving material concerning the inside proceedings of cartels concerning their daily administration and allocation of resources. This paper is a comparative, qualitative empirical study that utilizes the extensive archives of the Norwegian and Swedish brewery cartels and their regional sub-units called “circuits” to provide a valuable insight into the daily life of the two cartels and how members vied for influence and resources. Cartel theory is used as an analytical framework. Each cartel was divided into several circuits which had their own administrative apparatus, right of taxing members, and archives. The circuits’ meeting minutes and correspondence are examined to identify how members negotiated and pushed for influencing the national cartel board through their regional circuits. The paper finds that the circuits functioned as intermediaries between the national cartel board and individual members. The national board utilized the circuits for investigating cheating and communicating with members, while members could organize their regional interests to push back against larger and more influential members."

While Latin American countries since independence are usually perceived as extremely protectionist, the impact on industrial development remained weak. Argentina, which by the end of the 19th century was categorized as a rich nation, was not an exception. It is not clear whether fiscal, industrialists, or extractive reasons dominated the configuration of tariffs in the country. Previous studies about tariff protection in the region relied on total custom revenue data relative to import values. However, to understand the structure of tariffs in the country we propose an indicator that reflects the effects of changes in tariffs and prices. Using a bottom-up approach based on individual goods data we study how changes of policies and international circumstances shaped local protection. With this study we want to understand if commercial policy was correctly designed to promote industrial activities. Also, we attempt to distinguish when and how radical was the shift towards the import substitution regime at the beginning of the 20th century. Lastly, we will try to distinguish to what extent the extractive character of the Argentine economy was reflected in the design of its tariff system. By doing that we seek to stress that import substitution began as a sub-product of both world wars effects and the economic depression of the 1930s, and not due to explicit economic policies. This lack of a correctly designed system would have hindered the development of the industrial sector in the country."

This research paper delves into what made Chicago stand out in terms of electric vehicle adoption as compared to similar cities. While electricity grids appear to have mattered greatly in promoting electric vehicle adoption, preliminary results suggest that infrastructural preconditions alone cannot explain the differences.

    "text": "The use of historical census microdata to study individual outcomes and intergenerational mobility has become mainstream in the economic history literature. However, because of uncertainty about how female occupations were reported, most papers focus solely on men.\nThis project will use a combination of historical data sources to assess female labor force participation in the past. As a starting point, I plan to use the 1910 Norwegian census, from which individual records are available, in combination with other statistical sources such as industry censuses (there was a comprehensive census of industries (fabrikktelling) in 1909) and labor market statistics. Moreover, there are contemporary written sources - the issue of ‘correct’ measurement is frequently discussed in the publications accompanying the printed tables. The project will build on existing economic-historical work on female labor force participation (e.g. Goldin, Humphries, Meerkerk) in conjunction with more recent economics work on comprehensive historical microdata.\nBased on preliminary analyses, I expect to find a substantial level of female labor participation even when relying on the census alone; for example, 80 per cent of single and 11 per cent of married 40-year-old women in 1910 are registered with an occupation in census microdata. However, from previous literature, it is expected that combination with industrial and labor statistics will find that women’s formal labor force participation is under-represented in the census, in particular in industrial occupations.\nThe article will focus on (a) the ‘true’ female formal labor force participation in Norway in 1910, and how the definition of ‘formal’ affects this measurement, (b) the distribution of labor force participation by occupation, geography and marital status, as well as a comparison to male labor force participation and (c) an assessment of how well-suited census microdata is as a source of women’s position in the labor market in the early 1900s.\nAt this point, the focus of a the work is Norway circa 1910. However, I do not rule out a later extension to other countries (for comparative purposes) or to other Norwegian censuses (to assess a time trend)."

    "text": "Most accounts of state capacity treat only the central state or the state as a unitary actor. Apart from missing diversity on a horizontal level – branches of the central government might have higher or lower capacities –this approach crucially omits vertical and geographical differences. This is even more important in countries with far reaching local self-governance, be it at state, regional or local level. In this article I will use the case of Sweden between in the 19th century to highlight how what is often seen as a strong unitary state actually functioned in a much different way than what is often assumed. Many of the new tasks that government took on from the second half of the nineteenth century fell on the shoulders of local government. Local level state capacity differed substantially both from that of the central government and between different localities."

Despite rising research interest, energy innovation policy evaluation is impeded by the lack of a long-run data set that links energy innovations to public funding data and contains information on the directionality of innovation. This paper will contribute to the debate around energy innovation policy research by presenting a novel long-term data set, linking significant Swedish innovations to public innovation funding between 1970 and 2021. The preliminary results indicate that interest in energy innovations is positively correlated with energy prices. Until the 2000s energy innovations were primarily concerned with improvements in fossil fuel technology rather than the development of renewable energy technologies. Only since the 2000s renewable energy innovation dominated in Sweden. Moreover, Swedish data confirms that public funding is important for the development of energy innovations especially for immature technologies. Energy innovation are 17% more likely to receive public funding compared to innovations from other fields. Furthermore, public institutions financed 15% more renewable energy innovations compared to private actors before the new renewables became competitive with conventional energy sources."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are just one of several categories of diseases that have been linked to slow economic development. This group of parasitic and bacterial diseases affects around 1.65 billion people worldwide and are mostly found in low-income communities, particularly in rural areas and urban slums with limited access to clean water and poor housing conditions (WHO, 2023). Yaws is a NTD that, due to lack of attention and funding, still affects people in this 21st century. One of the earliest demonstrations of the potential of mass antibiotic treatment in controlling and eliminating NTDs in Africa was the Nigerian anti-Yaws campaign. The British colonial government, in collaboration with local health officials and traditional healers in Nigeria recognized Yaws as a significant public health problem and initiated a mass treatment program in the 1940s and 1950s using penicillin to control the disease. It is thought to have been one of the most successful mass treatment campaigns of the disease and became a model for similar campaigns that were carried out in other countries (WHO, 1988). In West Africa mobile medical units had long been used to reach sparsely populated areas evolving from, or in close association with trypanosomiasis organizations (McLetchie, 1954). From 1947, medical field units in Nigeria conducted surveys to determine the occurrence of Yaws and other endemic diseases in various remote locations. These medical field units conducted extensive research prior to the launch of the yaws campaign, which facilitated a smooth transition from the planning phase to the full-scale campaign (Zahra, 1956). As such, these units appear to have been instrumental in the rapid control and treatment of the disease (McLetchie, 1954). By the mid-1960s, Yaws was declared eradicated in Nigeria but less than a decade later West Africa saw a resurgence of the disease following a policy shift which incorporated Yaws surveillance and control into primary healthcare (Asiedu et al, 2008). This paper aims to chart the historical prevalence of Yaws in Nigeria and how it responded to mass treatment campaigns. Using Annual Medical Reports for Nigeria (1900-1960), we investigate the contribution of mobile medical services to the success of the Yaws eradication campaign in Nigeria and ask what lessons from this experience can be applied to the challenge of providing healthcare services that reach the remote rural communities where NTDs remain."

    "text": "Access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy remains a critical issue in Africa, where 43% of the continent’s population, or more than half a billion people lack access to electricity, with the majority living in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite being home to nearly 18% of the world’s population, Africa accounts for less than 6% of global energy use (IEA, 2022). The United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals aim for universal access to energy for all. However, insufficient national energy supply in countries often results in remote communities being overlooked due to their distant settlement, low electricity demand, and poor payment capabilities. Using panel data on rural communities and households electrified by distributed off-grid energy solutions, we study the effects of Kenya’s and Tanzania’s rural electrification expansion since the 1990s. Both countries are at the forefront of off-grid electrification initiatives, but they differ in terms of government electrification strategies, with Kenya allowing some private participation in the form of Independent Power Producers (IPPs), while Tanzania maintains more state control with limited private participation. Using data on rural off-grid electricity projects, together with regional Demographic and Heath Survey (DHS) data, and night-time lights, we are assessing the communal benefits of electrification, beyond household connectivity, using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach. Moreover, by looking at the East African cases of Kenya and Tanzania, we are further able to investigate whether there are differences in communal- and household benefits of electrification depending on the public or private-oriented electrification strategy. By looking at community benefits, beyond household connectivity, we hope to contribute to how energy access could be defined, and by looking at public- and private participation, we hope to discover what the impact of the different strategies is towards the end consumer."

    "text": "Central banking has seemingly undergone tremendous change since the 2008 financial crisis, with the major central banks, such as the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, broadly viewed as having become more powerful. Yet, absent any significant changes to central bank mandates, any change to de facto power needs to be both theoretically conceived and empirically supported. This is especially important for the case of the European Central Bank – for which claims of increased power have been the most pronounced, and changes to mandate entirely absent. The European Central Bank is broadly considered to be the central bank designed to best fit the “ideal” of the central bank independence-model; a highly independent, rule-based central bank narrowly focused on maintaining price stability and (then thought) explicitly forbidden from acting as lender of last resort. Yet, some years into the euro crisis, the European Central Bank was innovating on unconventional monetary policies even more so than the Fed, with open-ended asset purchasing programs and targeted long-term repurchasing arrangements. During the Covid pandemic, the ECB was even admitting that its asset purchases would target member states in crisis. This paper does not compare the European Central Bank’s response to the euro crisis and the pandemic as separate cases, but instead examines ECB actions and public communication over the 2007-2022 period as a single, evolving case, a ‘critical juncture’ in the development of a new central banking regime. Analyzing central bank press conferences, reports, speeches and press coverage over this period, including the launch of the Transmission Protection Instrument in 2022, I demonstrate a process of continuous learning over time. I argue that through specific failures and controversies, as well as from successes, the European Central Bank has learned both what kind of policies it can pursue and how it should frame them to maintain legitimacy. In so doing it has reestablished and deepened its bureaucratic autonomy while maintaining its reputation vis-à-vis political audiences. The ECB has in practice been given a “license to innovate”, in other words a license to conduct monetary policy as art, while still maintaining that it is a science. This license arguably makes the ECB more powerful than it used to be. Yet, at the same time, the ECB along with other major central bank, face deeply financialized and liquidity-dependent global markets, partially of their own making, against which they are ‘powerless’ to do anything but backstop."

    "text": "The 20th century generally saw a trend of industrial concentration, and the beer markets were no exception. Indications from the US beer market point towards increased market concentration in the medium run (Greer, 1971). Concentration was partly driven by an increased will of antitrust authorities to allow already large brewing companies to merge with one another (such as Miller and Coors) to form mega-companies (Elzinga, 2011). The effect of mergers has also been an aspect of the British brewing industry, although not on the same scale as in the American case (Slade, 2004). The concentration trend was a distinct feature even in the proud Belgian beer market, where the number of breweries decreased from over 3000 to around 100 across the 20th century, and average brewery size increased twenty-fold (Swinnen & Briski, 2017). In contrast, the German market was notably less concentrated than the two Anglo-Saxon and the Belgian, having partly to do with the fact that beer consumption had clear regional dimensions, creating several large regional producers with similar shares in the national market as a whole (Adams, 2011).\nIn Sweden, the brewery sector went from being large and lively before World War I, to stale and segmented during the interwar period, with a large decrease in the number of active breweries, with few to no entries in the business for decades to come, and a trend towards large business groups (Sandberg, 2006; Box, 2017). During this era, marked by cartelization with large competition controls, there was no true national market for beer, but more or less all breweries only operated in their home regions. Gabrielsson (1970) noted a clear concentration phase from 1952 to 1967, but maintained that there were enough movement within the market, in terms of changing market shares, for it to still be termed competitive. By the 1980s then, the entire sector had been almost entirely eradicated, with few breweries remaining, and all but one had been nationalized. This paper quantifies market concentration in the long run, from about 1910 to 1990, which has not been done before, to find its take-off and acceleration. Before 1955, both regional and national market concentration is estimated. To find what was driving the concentration trend, several factors are included, such as cartel policies, state regulations and alcohol policy, the structure of exit rates, and the timing and effect of mergers and acquisitions."

Utifrån resultaten av dessa delundersökningar diskuterar jag sedan huruvida Långholmens spinnhus, och andra spinnhus i riket, främst ska ses som ekonomiska produktionsenheter eller som straffinrättningar. Jag tar då upp begreppet hushållsekonomi, som det beskrevs och förstods under 1700-talet. Jag vill undersöka huruvida det kan skapa en förståelse för vilken funktion spinn-och rasphuset hade i det tidigmoderna samhället, och varför det fanns kvar i över 100 år."

    "text": "In the interwar years, Nordic central bank cooperation intensified and expanded. Before World War I, the Scandinavian countries had communicated per letter and thematically narrow as members of Scandinavian Monetary Union (SMU). In the 1920s, some crisis meetings during the war evolved into an institutionalisation of physical SMU meetings which gradually broadened the cooperation thematically, although a major theme was re-establishing the union. Despite Iceland formally becoming part of the union in 1924, the union broke up with the end of the gold standard in 1931. Along the way, the scope of Scandinavian central bank cooperation had expanded considerably, and with it the urge to encompass the entire Nordic region. Hence at the September 1931 meeting in the home of Riksbank governor Ivar Rooth, where it was decided to follow the British lead and abandon the gold standard, Finland participated for the first time, with Finnish central bank governor – and later Prime Minister and President – Risto Ryti.\nThe 1931 meeting marks a new era of Nordic central bank cooperation, and the cooperation of the 1930s is interesting in many respects. The Nordics had to navigate in unchartered waters without the gold compass, and at that when threatened by a political and economic storm. Hence, this happened at a time when the Great Depression threatened the global economies, when international political, economic, and monetary cooperation disentangled, with pressure from the growth of new major social groups nationally, and generally in an age where increased theoretical, political, and social criticism of central bank policies challenged their position. Although primarily looking out for their national economies, the Nordics were nevertheless dependent on international economic cooperation to overcome the crisis, and hence the central bank cooperation of the 1930s is an interesting – yet completely overlooked – field of study on several levels.\nBased on the central bank archives of the Scandinavian central banks, this article discusses several research questions:\n\nAt the most basic level, what was discussed at the Nordic central bank meetings in the 1930s and how did this cooperation evolve over the decade?\nWas new theoretical and political criticism of the central banks discussed at the Nordic central bank meetings, and how did the central banks respond?\nHow did the Nordic central banks balance their concern for their national economies against the need to cooperate to overcome difficulties?\nHow did the Nordic central banks balance Nordic cooperation with that of new international central bank cooperation efforts like the BIS, and did they join forces to try to even out the power imbalance favouring the Great powers?\nTo the extent that the Nordic central banks were part of governmental efforts to counter the economic crisis and gradually had their independence curbed, how were they made part of and how did they respond to international small power efforts like the economic cooperation of the Oslo states, and did this conflict with their relationship with the central banks of the Great powers?"

    "text": "Denmark and Sweden have been hosting countries for similar types of migration since the 1980s. However, despite sharing the same socioeconomic characteristics, their migration policies have followed contrary paths since the 2000s. While Sweden has opted for a more generous policy in the last two decades, Denmark has chosen considerably more strict immigration policy, increasing the obstacles for a specific type of immigration. The consequences of these numerous policies have not yet been fully addressed in the literature. The starting point of this paper will be the first tighter policies implemented by Denmark in 2002, aimed at limiting a certain type of immigration, such as longer waiting times for obtaining residency and higher requirements for family reunification. The object of study will be to understand the consequences of this shift on the selection of migrants in terms of educational attainment and labor market outcomes after their arrival. For this, we will use register data from Denmark and Sweden, focusing on those origin countries which were more exposed to the change in policies and, at the same time, were the bigger source countries at that time. Given that Sweden did not change its immigration policy during these years, a difference-in-differences design will be used. The policy change is expected to have resulted in a decline in the number of arriving in Denmark, contrary to a stable flow in Sweden. As such, and given that the policy targeted refugees, the share of this type of immigration would be decreasing in Denmark. Finally, regarding income outcomes, we expect a decrease in the income of those who were targeted by the policies, showing the increasing obstacles for their effective integration. In conclusion, we expect to find a shift in the type and labor outcomes. The study of the consequences of these policies will help address its real impact and the consequences they may bring forward, as well as a better design of immigration policy based on empirical evidence."

Our comparison shows the flaws of these interpretations: on standard measures of land inequality, Sweden was more unequal than Prussia in the late 1800s, but nevertheless, obviously, the political outcomes were very different. We explore why land inequality had such different effects on politics in Sweden compared to Prussia, utilizing various measures of land inequality (share of land held by nobles; distribution of farm sizes; presence of large estates), looking at 241 election districts in Sweden from the imposition of universal male suffrage in 1909 to the 1940s, and 236 election districts in Prussia for all general election between 1871 and 1912. Land inequality, in its different measures, had no negative effect on vote participation in Sweden, no positive effect on the Conservative vote share, and no negative effect on the Socialist vote share. We explore why in a qualitative-historical section focusing on Scania, the most unequal region in Sweden but also the hotbed of democratic movements.

Going beyond the more aggregate level of previous studies of long-run income inequality to micro data with data on individuals, we bring out the importance of jobs and gender, and add a perspective including the entire income distribution, including low-income earners. For those who earned too little to pay tax (in 1900 70 %, in 1950 33 %), we estimate incomes by using other sources. We show that inequality was very high in 1870, decreasing until the 1900s, with a temporary spike of top incomes in 1920. The rural sector was very unequal in 1870 (almost as unequal as the urban). Beyond the rural-urban composition, we also show that domestic service was a very large sector in the beginning of our period, with low wages, and the shift out of domestic service (especially for women) induced greater equality, when people shifted to higher-paid jobs. Generally, the upgrading of working-class jobs to better paid, more skilled jobs is important to understand the equalization of incomes. In 1870 low skilled farm labourers and domestic servants were a large part of the working class but by 1930 the jobs structure had been upgraded. We also investigate the role of capital incomes versus labour incomes for equalization, and themes such as the shift away from farming, the gender gap, and regional and urban-rural income differences."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Forskningsfältet rörande svenska historiska kreditmarknader, som i huvudsak bygger på bouppteckningar och behandlas inom skilda discipliner såsom historia, agrarhistoria, ekonomisk-historia, etnologi och kulturgeografi, har trots utnyttjandet av varierande metoder ändå nått resultat som ofta har förstärkt och kompletterat varandra utan alltför stora motsättningar. Nya kunskaper om den övergripande bilden av kreditmarknaden har därigenom etablerats, vilka öppnar för nya tolkningar av större ekonomiska skeenden i samhällsförändringen. Möjligen har det dock uppstått en risk för en sorts övertro på vad bouppteckningarna faktiskt kan ge svar om. Syftet är här att med hjälp av en unik källa, dagboksanteckningar förda av bonden Ored Olsson (1791–1883) i Grönhult (Villands härad, Kristianstads län) kring mitten av 1800-talet, i en fallstudie beskriva, fördjupa och analysera sådana aspekter av enskildas kreditrelationer som inte täcks av de många bouppteckningsstudierna. En i stora drag kvantitativ bild av kreditmarknaden behöver fördjupas för att nå större förståelse av agerandet hos samtidens aktörer i en historienarrativ som förs framifrån, utan att bombarderas i alltför hög grad med vår tids efterklokskap. De blixtbilder som bouppteckningar kan ge av kreditmarknadens konkreta innehåll måste därför kompletteras med hjälp av studier baserade på mer kontinuerligt förda källor. Det unika betraktas här som ett generellt fenomen som utgör själva essensen i humaniora, varför syftet inte behöver störas av krav på representativitet eller statistisk signifikans. Forskningsfrågorna är: Hur genomfördes affärstransaktioner på landsbygden i praktiken, förekom till exempel transporter av reverser på andra personer? Vilka valutor användes? Hur uppfattade aktörerna sina kreditrelationer, var de enbart en resurs eller kunde de också bli en belastning? Fanns det olika typer av mellanmänskliga relationer som grundade sig på ekonomiska utbyten, till exempel formella lån och förtroendelån? Hur stor andel utgjorde transaktioner eller prestationer i natura? Vilken betydelse hade kreditrelationer mellan land och stad? Vilken roll spelade kvinnorna i de personliga nätverken? Metodologin anknyter till tidigare studier i bondedagböcker (se till exempel Bo Larsson, 1992. Svenska bondedagböcker. Ett nationalregister. Stockholm: Nordiska museet) inom agrarhistorisk, lokalhistorisk, kulturhistorisk och genealogisk forskning, med i huvudsak kvalitativa angreppssätt, men bygger samtidigt på en kvantitativ bakgrundsanalys av enskilda dagboksnotiser. Social Network Analysis (SNA) används däremot inte här, eftersom resultatet av en sådan sannolikt skulle ge en delvis förutsägbar bild, med dagboksförfattaren som självskrivet epicentrum, och även sakna möjligheter att belysa mellanmänskliga relationer i de sociala aktivitetsfältens periferi.

    "text": "Forskningsfältet rörande svenska historiska kreditmarknader, som i huvudsak bygger på bouppteckningar och behandlas inom skilda discipliner såsom historia, agrarhistoria, ekonomisk-historia, etnologi och kulturgeografi, har trots utnyttjandet av varierande metoder ändå nått resultat som ofta har förstärkt och kompletterat varandra utan alltför stora motsättningar. Nya kunskaper om den övergripande bilden av kreditmarknaden har därigenom etablerats, vilka öppnar för nya tolkningar av större ekonomiska skeenden i samhällsförändringen. Möjligen har det dock uppstått en risk för en sorts övertro på vad bouppteckningarna faktiskt kan ge svar om. Syftet är här att med hjälp av en unik källa, dagboksanteckningar förda av bonden Ored Olsson (1791–1883) i Grönhult (Villands härad, Kristianstads län) kring mitten av 1800-talet, i en fallstudie beskriva, fördjupa och analysera sådana aspekter av enskildas kreditrelationer som inte täcks av de många bouppteckningsstudierna. En i stora drag kvantitativ bild av kreditmarknaden behöver fördjupas för att nå större förståelse av agerandet hos samtidens aktörer i en historienarrativ som förs framifrån, utan att bombarderas i alltför hög grad med vår tids efterklokskap. De blixtbilder som bouppteckningar kan ge av kreditmarknadens konkreta innehåll måste därför kompletteras med hjälp av studier baserade på mer kontinuerligt förda källor. Det unika betraktas här som ett generellt fenomen som utgör själva essensen i humaniora, varför syftet inte behöver störas av krav på representativitet eller statistisk signifikans. Forskningsfrågorna är: Hur genomfördes affärstransaktioner på landsbygden i praktiken, förekom till exempel transporter av reverser på andra personer? Vilka valutor användes? Hur uppfattade aktörerna sina kreditrelationer, var de enbart en resurs eller kunde de också bli en belastning? Fanns det olika typer av mellanmänskliga relationer som grundade sig på ekonomiska utbyten, till exempel formella lån och förtroendelån? Hur stor andel utgjorde transaktioner eller prestationer i natura? Vilken betydelse hade kreditrelationer mellan land och stad? Vilken roll spelade kvinnorna i de personliga nätverken? Metodologin anknyter till tidigare studier i bondedagböcker (se till exempel Bo Larsson, 1992. Svenska bondedagböcker. Ett nationalregister. Stockholm: Nordiska museet) inom agrarhistorisk, lokalhistorisk, kulturhistorisk och genealogisk forskning, med i huvudsak kvalitativa angreppssätt, men bygger samtidigt på en kvantitativ bakgrundsanalys av enskilda dagboksnotiser. Social Network Analysis (SNA) används däremot inte här, eftersom resultatet av en sådan sannolikt skulle ge en delvis förutsägbar bild, med dagboksförfattaren som självskrivet epicentrum, och även sakna möjligheter att belysa mellanmänskliga relationer i de sociala aktivitetsfältens periferi. Dagböckerna förvaras i Kulturhistoriska museets arkiv i Lund och har tidigare främst utnyttjats av den lokalhistoriska forskningen, och omfattar en sammanhängande tidsperiod, 1833–1846, samt därefter några spridda år; 1852, 1854 och 1856–1857.

    "text": "Due to declining working capacity at old age, individuals have throughout history assured against loss of income through family networks, life-cycle savings and or public welfare. As part of my thesis, this paper addresses declining work capacity by examining old-age assurance strategies in the County of Västerbotten between 1890-1960. More specifically, I focus on the assurance through market relations (including labour-wage and occupational pensions)family networks, and the public sector (including social security and poor relief).\nThe period of study includes major structural and institutional changes expected to have altered individual’s assurance strategies, such as the introduction of compulsory public pensions. In theory, the expansion of pensions may have down-played dependency on labour income and family network at higher ages. This paper examines the elderly’s occupations, and how family networks varied in relation occupation and SES.\nThe empirical setting is the county of Västerbotten in the northern Sweden, which underwent a rapid industrial development, mainly in the forestry sector, as well as changing migration patterns during the period of study. Due to digitalization of church records (POPLINK-database), it is possible to conduct longitudinal analysis of all individuals living in the area. The database contains data on occupation, number of- and proximity to adult children, marital status and if the individual receives support from the poor house or municipal old age home. Based on data from the database, this paper provides descriptive statistics of the elderly’s occupations and family networks, in the rural and urban settings of Västerbotten between 1890 and 1955."

Focusing on a Protestant and otherwise homogeneous country, we construct a rich microlevel dataset of 619 butter factories (creameries), the main catalyst of the industrial revolution in Denmark. The Inner Mission - a neo-piestist movement, caused conflict by advocating for the closure of creameries on Sundays in accordance with the Third Commandment. We find that this conflict led to lower productivity in creameries. Using two Bartik-style instruments - the presence of Carl Moe and the spread of Inner Mission in 1890, both before the period studied - we find that the effect is best explained by the creameries’ conflict about religious questions rather than the closure of creameries on Sundays by itself. Our results suggest that non-violent religious conflict can have a negative impact on productivity, which in turn might have long-term consequences for development."

In books, blogs, social media accounts and newspaper interviews, men and women in their 20s and 30s describe their determination to reappropriate the time usurped by the contemporary capitalist lifestyle of constant work and consumption – they want to quit their jobs!\nOriginating from the US, the basic idea of FIRE is to live extremely frugally for a limited period (around 10 years), invest all income surplus in low-cost index funds and by the age of 40 be able to stop working and instead live the rest of your life off capital income. While the desire to skip the “rat race” has emerged in various contexts throughout the industrial capitalist period, the technique for “ordinary” wage earners to strive for financial independence and early retirement through stock-market investments has not been seen before. FIRE followers’ beliefs and endeavors seem to result in a paradoxical moral economy of, on the one hand, resisting cornerstones of late-capitalist society – wage labour, over-consumption, and household debt – while, on the other, consenting to the power of the financial markets and relying completely on the continued growth of capital invested in it. Moreover, FIRE presupposes that retirement – escaping salaried work – is the most desirable state in life.\nA new research project, funded by the Swedish Research Council 2023-26 (project leader Charlotte Nilsson), will explore FIRE both as lived reality (for the few) and sociocultural imaginary (for the many). The conference paper will focus on the ideological aspects that concern work-criticism and retirement in the light of the Swedish political-economic development. Globally, the FIRE movement has emerged against the background of welfare state decline – most notably privatization of pensions – and financialization (i.e. growing influence of financial markets) as well as a strong stock-market recovery since the global financial crisis of 2008. While this development certainly holds true also for Sweden, the stakes are different: Swedish FIRE aspirants can, as opposed to for example their American counterparts, still rely on a future with stately parental insurance, public healthcare, and national retirement pension."

    "text": "The current paper attempts to add to our understanding of the workings of the land market in early modern Holland over the long term in periods of economic growth, decline, and structural transition. It aims to do so by exhausting information from a uniquely kept source: the schepenbankprotocollen from Hazerswoude, a rural town southeast of Leiden. The sources contain serial information on all formal land exchanges in the area, including the exchanging parties (and often their familial relations), land prices, collateral, and the date the debt was paid or defaulted. This allows us to reconstruct the details of all formal land exchanges between 1555-1808, focusing on the period 1555-1684. By doing so, the paper attempts to gain insight into the constituents of the land market, adding to our understanding of the growth of Holland’s rural economy, its transition to agrarian capitalism, and the market-induced drivers of land inequality."

    "title": "The Market Mightier Than the Family? A Case Study of Market Transfers and Land Distribution in Holland, 1555-1684",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The current paper attempts to add to our understanding of the workings of the land market in early modern Holland over the long term in periods of economic growth, decline, and structural transition. It aims to do so by exhausting information from a uniquely kept source: the schepenbankprotocollen from Hazerswoude, a rural town southeast of Leiden. The sources contain serial information on all formal land exchanges in the area, including the exchanging parties (and often their familial relations), land prices, collateral, and the date the debt was paid or defaulted. This allows us to reconstruct the details of all formal land exchanges between 1555-1808, focusing on the period 1555-1684. By doing so, the paper attempts to gain insight into the constituents of the land market, adding to our understanding of the growth of Holland’s rural economy, its transition to agrarian capitalism, and the market-induced drivers of land inequality."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It is widely acknowledged that for countries to catchup in productivity, they need to go through a process of technological upgrading. Although few African countries have caught up with the developed countries, one cannot deny that many African countries went through a process of technological adaptation over the past century. Under different technological paradigms, countries responded to the diffusion of technological revolutions, unfolding over the twentieth and twenty first centuries. However, since most African countries have not yet made the step to developed status, the process technological adaptation is left relatively unexplored. What explains the types and process of technological adaption over the long run in Africa? This paper attempts to contribute to this question by exploring the change of productive structures of Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire over the past century. The study aims to identify the similarities and differences in the types and processes of technological adaptation in these countries. Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire make an excellent comparative study for several reasons. Both countries are located in West Africa and share similar factor endowments and socio-economic characteristics, including similar levels of GDP per Capita, a history of colonialism and a history of dependence on cash crops. Secondly, both countries have experienced significant structural changes in their productive structure over the past century, yet there are important differences between the two countries as to which industries have been appropriated. By analyzing evolution of this process, this paper seeks to explain the factors that have shaped the diffusion and adaptation and the failure of adaptation of technological paradigms in Africa. To achieve this objective, the paper employs the concepts of social capabilities, technological congruency, and path dependence. We preliminarily find that successful technological upgrading has usually been a gradual one, in line with the country’s already existing productive capabilities. Leapfrogging technologies hasn’t had an enduring effect on the productive structure of the two countries. The type of successful technological adaptation seems to have been explained by factors common to the two countries, whilst differences in social capabilities between the two countries seem to explain the extent of technological adaptation. Some of these differences are rooted in long run historical factors that gave Ghana a head start in a cumulative process of structural transformation, whilst others are the consequences of paradigm shifts in government policies."

The reasons include memories of stagflation in the 1980s, the success of the German Bundesbank in keeping inflation in check, the memories of the ERM crisis in the early 1990s and the preparation for the independent European Central Bank (ECB). Revised central bank laws provided for independence for several central banks in mature economies, including the Bank of England, Riksbanken, the ECB and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Central bank autonomy had already been defined and analysed, in particular with respect to monetary policy outcome and the ability to keep inflation in check. A framework by Bade & Parkin in 1977 formed the basis for analysis of autonomy and has been refined and further developed by among others Grilli, Masciandaro & Tabellini (1991), Cukierman (1992) and Arnone et al (2006). The autonomy or independence can be analysed in terms of de jure and de facto independence to tease out what independence means in practice. The new Bank of Japan law in 1998 provided for an independent central bank. This paper analyses the de jure and de facto independence of the Bank of Japan and how unconventional monetary policy affected this and finds that the increased intertwining of monetary and fiscal policy makes the independence somewhat illusory."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing rapidly in developing countries due to economic development, decreasing levels of physical activity, and shifting diets and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) tend to have significantly higher obesity prevalence than the global average. This study aims to understand socioeconomic differences in female obesity in different island contexts. Dietary habits and obesity among mothers and pregnant women can affect their offspring, thus affecting the health of younger generations. Female obesity is, therefore, a health concern that extends across generations.\nThe four countries in the study share characteristics such as remote location, growing and often low-skilled populations, limited land-based resources, small domestic markets, and high dependence on international trade. However, they also represent different levels of economic development and obesity patterns. The Maldives, an upper middle-income country located in the Indian Ocean, has a relatively modest prevalence of female obesity (11.4% in 2016). Samoa, in the Pacific Ocean, is a lower middle-income country with one of the highest prevalence rates of female obesity in the world (55% in 2016). Timor-Leste is also a lower middle-income country but has the lowest prevalence of female obesity of the four (4.9 % in 2016). Fiji, an upper-middle-income country in the Pacific Ocean, has a more ethnically diverse population and a lower prevalence of female obesity than other countries in the Pacific Ocean (35% in 2016).\nThe relationship between socioeconomic status (SES), economic development, and obesity is complex. In lower-income countries, higher SES groups are more likely to be obese, while in high-income countries, those with higher SES are less likely to be obese. Economic development can lead to improvements in health, but it can also lead to overconsumption, which affects SES groups differently.\nThe study draws upon two data sources: the Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) for Fiji and Samoa, and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for the Maldives and Timor-Leste. The variables in the two data sources are highly comparable.\nThe preliminary regression results indicate that in the Maldives, there is a clear SES gradient in obesity, with the lowest SES group (those with primary or lower education) having the highest odds of being obese. This is a pattern commonly observed in high-income countries. In contrast, in Samoa and Timor-Leste, those with higher levels of education have higher odds of obesity. This is a common pattern in many developing countries at the early stages of the obesity transition. The Fijian patterns do not follow the other countries, as the associations change when control variables are added. Crude estimates show the highest obesity among those least educated, while adjusted estimates. The Fijian results also hide a story of ethnic differences as they play a crucial role in explaining SES patterns in obesity."

When the first main lines began to be built in Sweden during the mid-19th century, cultivation was an integral component of the railway system, comprising aesthetic gardens, protective cultivation, and kitchen gardens. Despite the large areas and resources this cultivation demanded, our current knowledge about why gardens were established, and when attitudes towards them began to change, is surprisingly limited.\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss the results from my PhD-thesis “The State as Gardener: Railway Cultivation from the Art of Improving Nature to Bequest” (2022), with the purpose to analyse and discuss the events and ideals that characterised the rise and fall of the gardening organisation of the Swedish State Railways. Chronologically the study includes two key periods: the construction phase of 1855–1875 and the decline phase of 1955–1975. Archive material has been located by using the railway’s organisational system as a starting point. The method used to analyse archive material and published sources has consisted of text analysis, inspired by discourse perspectives and the theory of path dependence. With the concepts of modernity and place as points of departure, this paper discusses how the transition, from gardens being fundamental to the railway system to their being phased out from the organisation, can be understood and explained.\nGardens were among the perceived benefits of railways, where they played a key role when new places were created alongside the lines. During the construction phase of 1855–1875, railway gardens were characterised by the ideal of “the art of improving nature” (naturförsköningskonsten) and that of nation-building. The organisation and coordination of gardening, including for example plant nurseries and gardeners, was a fundamental railway activity. During the decline phase of 1955–1975, a performance-based realignment led to a focus on rationalisation and economic cutbacks. Post-war ideals of modernisation, a new rail policy, road transport and an increased emphasis on urgency all contributed to the declining role of the railways. Structure, order, aesthetics, progress and education were no longer expressed in the same way through gardens. Many places changed. Arenas where people once spent time now became areas to simply pass through.\nHow ideals influenced material expression, and the factors considered conducive for modernity, are discussed in the paper. Nineteenth-century industrial modernity provided the impetus for railway gardens. High modernity in the second half of the 20th century led to initial downsizing and eventually, in 1973 to the closure of the nurseries and revised tasks for the gardeners. Prior to the latter changes, “wills” were drawn up: assessments of existing gardens that were used to bequeath responsibility from a central to a local level. These changes in the State organisation and structures are also discussed in the paper."

    "text": "Varje kris är unik, och även coronakrisen skiljer ut sig bland de industriella, finansiella och pandemiska kriser som Sverige och övriga världen upplevt under de senaste två hundra åren. Vi vet genom tidigare studier att krisers påverkan på samhället är stor, och bland annat tar sig uttryck i produktionsbortfall, långtidsarbetslöshet och kreativ destruktion. Dessutom vet vi att kriser tenderar att förstärka redan pågående förändringsprocesser, i termer av nya arbetssätt och rutiner, teknologiska språng samt nya värde- och distributionskedjor. Syftet i vårt projekt är att kartlägga och analysera hur det svenska näringslivet påverkades av coronakrisen (Covid 19). Till stöd för våra observationer och resultat äger vi tillgång till ett omfattande källmaterial, bestående av tre typer: 1) enkäter inhämtade vid åtta tillfällen; djupintervjuer med 50 personer från företag (branschmässig, geografisk och storleksmässig spridning) samt mediabevakning. Datainhämtningen har ägt rum i realtid under coronakrisen, från mars 2020 och framåt.\nI vårt paper kommer vi kunna ge svar på hur företagens verksamheter påverkats på kort och lång sikt, hur omvärldsförändringar och samhällsstöd påverkat verksamheten samt hur medierapporteringen om företagen sett ut och förändrats över tid. Med våra resultat som utgångspunkt kommer vi kunna diskutera coronakrisens långsiktiga påverkan på samhället, i termer av vilka branscher som drabbats mest samt i vilken mån krisen lett till deurbanisering, hybridisering, avkontorisering och nya konsumtionsmönster."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this article, I provide an analysis covering 900 years of French history and study the long-term influence of free property of land on resistance to authoritarianism and support for democracy. To do so, I build on the work of historians who identified that, during the Middle Ages and until the French Revolution, rules on the property of land varied between French regions. Generally speaking, the eastern part of France adopted rules more favourable to free property of land, ensuring landowners with a greater protection against the local or national authorities. Free property was qualified as alleu (allods) and the land was then said to be allodial, meaning that lands owned as such were estates over which the allodial landowner had full ownership and right of alienation, and which were independent of any superior landlord. These properties could be either hold by noblemen, religious organisations or commoners. I identify to which area municipalities were belonging as regards the local legislation on land ownership, based on the information available in these legislations. I complement this measure by two others based on the old and actual toponymy of French municipalities (or places within the boundaries of municipalities) to identify areas where the allodial property was common from the Middles Ages to the nineteenth century. Then, I directly link the concentration of free ownership to the long-lasting influence of Roman law, which was stronger close to the cities that were granted the ius italicum. This Roman law granted cities outside Italy the same rights as if they were located on the Italian soil, namely that people born in the city would be considered as Roman citizens, able to fully own property, to buy and sell it. Having done so, I investigate the influence of free property on the resistance to the implementation of absolute Monarchy in France. Building on a new dataset covering 200 years of rebellions (1600 to 1800), I identify that municipalities where freehold land was legally possible more strongly resisted the implementation of the new national and autocratic regime. A municipality located in areas favourable to land property, or whose toponymy showed signs of free property, was more likely to be characterised by rebellions against both local authorities, feudalism and national authorities during this period of time. Subsequently, I evaluate the impact of free ownership of land on the democratization process in France, showing a stronger support for democracy during the elections which saw the progressive implementation of democracy in France in areas of free land property. Freehold land, inherited from the Roman law, was therefore a strong determinant of resistance to authoritarianism in France and later contributed to its democratisation."

Public and private organisations had to face major challenges, including bankruptcies of businesses and a decline in GDP, triggering structural change. The Pandemic induced considerable organisational and structural change as well as technological renewal, not least digitalisation. Economic sectors that for various reasons could not make use of the new technology were the ones who suffered most. But business organisations seem to have responded differently to the exogenous shock. The purpose of our paper is to find out how business actors perceived and managed the shock, by conducting a case study of Sweden. Our survey is based on three questions. 1) How did the organisations perceive that their operations were affected by the pandemic? 2) What guidance did the organisations use to navigate throughout the crisis? 3) To what extent did the organisations take advantage of the crisis to make changes and strengthen their positions? The answers to these questions come from questionaries and interviews with representatives of organisations in various types of sectors, gathered from the start of the pandemic in Spring 2020 until early 2023."

    "text": "In our recent article on central bank cooperation and lender of last resort in the Scandinavian Monetary Union (Ögren & Trautwein 2022) we found that in the context of a common currency operated by the three independent central banks of Denmark, Norway and Sweden the most important workhorse that emerged was the clearing system between the central banks. We could show that this system was also in operation after the “classical” gold standard had been abandoned in 1914, at least until the year 1930. Without the possibility to develop the issue further within the scope of the article we see some evidence that the SMU clearing system complemented and to some extent replaced the clearing carried out by private financial agents. Moreover, we have now found evidence that it was carried on even after the abandonment of the interwar period gold standard in 1931. Not only did this central bank clearing cooperation within the SMU gain interest from central bankers and financial agents abroad; our material also suggests possible links between the experiences of the SMU clearing system and the development of the Bank for International Settlements into an international facility for central banks when the mission of the BIS shifted from its original role of organizing the settlements of German war reparations to an agency for co-ordinating monetary policies to counteract the Great Depression. Setting our focus on links between the SMU and the BIS in the 1920s and 1930s, we aim at elucidating the role of clearing in the development of international central banking. We combine practical, political, and theoretical perspectives that were developed (rather) disparately in contemporaneous operations, debates and research, as well as in more recent academic literature: o At the practical level, clearing in the SMU (and perhaps also within the BIS network) was operated “in the machine rooms” of central banking, apparently with little or rare attention by governing bodies, public debates or academic research. o At the political level, clearing was now and then debated as a matter of trade-offs between international cooperation and national autonomy, but rather detached from its actual workings. o At the level of “high theory”, clearing and connected issues of the settlement of debts, cumulative changes in the price level and financial stability have played a key role in views on the evolution of the international monetary system in the tradition of Wicksell, Keynes, and Hicks (in particular). The historical contexts of the SMU and the BIS, and the connections between them, serve as a case for combining the three perspectives and for testing the ‘Theory of Monetary History’ in the Wicksell-Keynes-Hicks connection."

Between 1910 and 1938, the so-called Contraceptive Law prohibited oral and written information about contraceptives as well as window display and outdoor circulation of birth control products. According to a government report, the law led to information on sex and contraceptives mainly being produced and distributed by contraceptive retailers and manufacturers. By primarily analyzing marketing and government reports, this chapter investigates how people received information about contraceptives between 1910–1938 and why businesses became key actors in the distribution of sex education in the early 20th century. The chapter also relates to a larger narrative on how the contraceptive market developed despite being restricted by law."

These dynamics, observed both in today’s globalized world and in past waves of globalization, have an important regional dimension, with some regions striving and some declining. The historical literature has been increasingly interested in relating the pre-industrial regional specialization with the subsequent location of industrial activity during the take-off of modern economic growth. In particular, the British case studied within the Cambridge Population Group has shown a high level of specialization well before the beginning if the First Industrial Revolution (Keibek, 2017a, 2017b, 2017c). These results have revived the interest in the study of the proto industrial activities, which have been approached in the past using case-studies (Isaacsson & Magnusson, 1987). We embrace the quantitative approach proposed by the Cambridge Population Group and look at the case of Sweden, a late industrializer that developed into one of the most dynamic economies of the continent and relate the regional patterns before the industrial take-off to the subsequent location of industrial activity later on. We rely on a novel database on the occupational structure of the Swedish parishes from 1750 to 1850 based on data from Tabellverket. Using GIS, we create time-invariant parish boundaries that allow to track employment change over time using consistent geographical units. We then test whether the employment structure of parishes during the industrial take-off responded the pre-industrial occupational specialization."

Recent evidence suggests the historic fundamental change for economic progress seems to not have been high growth rates, but compound growth through the elimination of negative growth episodes, i.e., ‘shrinking’. All economies seem to be able to grow, but few countries have been able to drastically improve their shrinking patterns, which has underpinned the divergence often argued in literature. However, whilst growth theory does not consider the role of shrinking, shrinking has not yet clearly defined itself from growth processes, leaving shrinking research more generally indistinguishable from classic growth economics. To solve these research gaps, Growth and Resilience Theory proposes growth processes to be those with the ability to shift a production function up whereas building resilience is the ability to move through a production function, specifically by guarding against backsliding. Long-run convergence is an economy’s ability to balance their growth- and resilience-based institutions to maximise the space under their respective production function.

Due to the currency regulations, the Riksbank believed it could act with some independence visavi international economic pressures. The Riksbank hence acted with the purpose of upholding the economic and regulatory regime. However, these actions led to the unavoidable demise of the regime.

From the time studies of early 20th century scientific management to the Swedish state’s guidelines for efficient housework in the mid-1900s, individual productivity was key.

The case study provides a Swedish perspective on the global personal time management industry and shows how individual privacy and personality were included in the presented ideas and tools: Planning one’s time and researching one’s priorities were methods not only to achieve higher productivity and, thus, more professional success, but also to become a ‘better’, more fit individual in general."

The defeat of Mexico in 1848 and the subsequent loss of territory allowed for a manageable and less threatened border. At the same time, it encouraged a political agreement in the center of the country on the importance of controlling that border and occupying that territory. In this paper we use a panel model as well as a synthetic control analysis to show how these changes did produce a trend change in the demographics of the northern states (except Sonora), reflecting a greater capacity of the Mexican state to protect its territory and even exploit it economically. By 1862 these changes allowed the Mexican state to survive precisely in those territories that were its greatest weakness between 1846 and 1848."

    "text": "Privatization has resulted in the changed ownership of important sectors of developed economies, including telecommunications, aviation, railways and utilities. While outright privatization has been less commonplace and extensive in public services (education, health care and social care) different forms of marketization have, nevertheless, been implemented. Broadly defined, marketisation refers to an increase in the private-sector production of goods and services previously undertaken by the state and the allocation of these resources through market arrangements, where non-market forms of administration previously prevailed. Most importantly, this has resulted in services in the public sector being provided by actors other than governments yet still being financed by revenue generated from taxation.While there is a huge literature on privatization of state-owned enterprises, and a growing literature on marketization of welfare services, there is still no quantitative mapping of the process of marketization showing when and to what extent this has taken place in different countries across time. According to the stylized facts presented in the literature on the European welfare states – social democratic (Nordic), conservative (Continental) and liberal (Anglo-Saxon) – a corresponding pattern in the structure and dynamics marketization could be expected. However, the present paper highlights that marketization only follows these stylized facts to a limited extent and in crucial aspects has been most rapid and radical in “social democratic” Sweden. These findings are based on OECD data that in very broad terms allows the tracking of marketization in education and health care back to the mid-1990s, and in the case of education partially back to the 1970s. To make this broad picture of marketization patterns more comprehensive, this paper aims to track the process of marketization in more detail and further back in time (to at least 1980) for a handful of countries. In so doing this paper will answer, firstly, when the levels of marketization began to rise and, secondly, map the various forms marketization that have taken place in education and health care systems. The most promising countries with regards the availability of data are Austria, Germany, France, and Sweden. In the political economy literature privatization and marketization have both been subject to a significant amount of analysis and theorization, however the focus has primarily been placed on the role of politics and ideology, leaving out the extent and character of the actual processes. This situation has been compounded by a lack of precise quantitative data arising from the conventions of national accounting, with the recommendation that countries measure both the industrial and institutional distribution of production at a disaggregated level only appearing in the SNA 2008. This paper therefore aims to open up new avenues of research by examining both these aspects for education and health care over past decades. It will further contribute to the literature by critically assessing the conventional ideational explanations of the driving causes of marketization. An alternative explanation is that marketization has been pushed by the contemporaneous and increasing process of financialization. A test is provided by analyzing how the extent of financialization across countries corresponds with the extent of marketization in the public services."

Much of this work points to the modest growth of modern manufacturing in Africa during the twentieth century and offers new formulations for manufacturing to develop on the continent. To explain past failures of industrialization in Africa, economists have mainly focused on inefficient economic policies in the post-colonial period. Recent work in economic history focuses more on structural impediments, most notable low population densities that push wages upwards and at the same time limits domestic demand for locally produced manufacturing goods (Austin, Frankema and Jerven 2015, Austin 2016, Frankema and Waijenburg 2018).\nThis paper contributes to the debate by shifting focus from outcomes to intentions and attempts to industrialise in 20th century Africa. Without dismissing the role of economic policies or structural impediments what is exceptional with Africa is the few attempts made to promote manufacturing growth. Through a comparative historical analysis we argue that efforts to industrialise was depending on how well it aligned with the economic interests of national and transnational elite. Without support from these two groups the African colonial and post-colonial states lacked the capacity to formulate long-term industrial policies, which in part also explain the meagre performance of manufacturing sector."

The current design of Swedish sickness benefit has long been debated, with several reforms being made partly in relation to statistics showing at times high sickness rates for Sweden in relation to other comparable countries. Sickness rates are, however, highly governed by how a country have chosen to handle welfare benefits in relation to those being long-term ill, something that has historical roots. Sickness benefit in Sweden has its origins both in the sickness fund movement and the national pension system. Sickness funds were voluntary and often membership run organisations that began to expand in the decades leading up to the turn of the century 1900, while the 1913 pension system was grounded on universalism and had a focus on disability rather than on old age. The two forms of insurance can be seen as complementary, where sickness funds were to provide financial compensation for shorter illnesses, while the disability pension was implemented for those who became permanently ill. However, the extent of the two insurances was on several levels far from satisfactory and reforms were constantly discussed. In addition, many people that fell ill still had to rely on the old poor relief system. This paper addresses the question of boundaries between the different forms of economic support to workers who could no longer support themselves due to illness, and asks questions such as for whom and for what these insurances where used. The analysis uses individual level data on people that received disability pension, sickness benefit and/or poor relief in the 1920s and 1930s together with qualitative data on the organisation of these insurances. Data is collected from the city of Landskrona."

This essay explores the relationship between protectionist economic policies such as mercantilism in colonial North America and protectionist tariffs passed in the early years of the United States. It first looks at how the British-American colonies developed their economies in the shadow of mercantilist rules regulating how and to whom they could trade.

Structural and policy issues contributing to a growing rift between colonial merchants and British policy creators. Conversely, the second half of the essay explores the realities of founding a new nation attempting to find its place within the global economy. It shows that trade tariffs were an important component of developing state capacity and finding revenue in the early stages of the young nation’s existence. Later, as manufacturing became a more important segment of the economy, national leaders turned to tariffs to protect its growing manufacturing sector. The colonies who chafed under the protectionist British state eventually created their own protectionist policies to protect its own economic interests. In both instances, however, these policies had unintended consequences for the nature and composition of trade."

    "text": "In this paper, I will analyse how the number and composition of artisan workshops in four Swedish towns changed in the latter half of the 19th century. During this period, Sweden went through drastic changes on institutional, social and economic levels. I will investigate how two of these changes – early industrialisation and increased freedom of trade – affected the artisan trades. Industrialisation has received much attention in research, but often with a focus on inventions and factories. Less attention has been given to how this development affected the artisan trades. Overlapping with early industrialisation, new legislation promoting freedom of trade for artisans were introduced in Sweden through the Factory and Handicraft Regulation (1846) and the Decree of Extended Freedom of Trade (1864). These new laws reduced entry barriers, abolished the guilds and made it possible for a wider proportion of society, including women, to open artisan workshops – at least in theory. The study is focused on artisans in the towns Helsingborg, Karlskrona, Landskrona, and Lund in Southern Sweden.\nPrevious research looking at the development of artisan trades has mostly worked on an aggregate level or focused on a specific trade, but this study will be based on a database containing individual artisans of all trades. The database has been created by digitising a set of craft censuses, consisting of annual workshop-level data including information about the name of owner and number of employees. This individual level data will provide a detailed level of understanding, as we can follow how both workshops and trades fared through the years. To look at the effect of industrialisation, we can compare these numbers with the development of competing factories in the area to analyse which trades might be affected the most by industrialisation. The database is also used to look at how the legal changes affected the number of workshops. Here it is special interest to see if we can find a change in how long companies stay in business before and after the changes and if this varies by type of trade, since this can give us a hint about barriers of entrance. It is also of interest to see if the gender distribution of the proprietors changed with the new legislation."

    "text": "Climate warming and other consequences of fossil fuel emissions has recently elevated the industrial revolution to the status of a geological event or epoch as the anthropocene. Looking for causes rather than consequences, this article proposes to see the fossil energy transition as a homeostatic response to climate cooling. Historical interest in the energy transition is commonly derivative from attempts to interpret the industrial revolution, but the fact remains that the English energy transition to coal was driven by domestic heating. Leading interpretations see it as arising from a population-resource crisis or from rapid commercialisation starting in the late 16th century that led to the introduction of chimneys (the characteristic feature proposed for the coal-burning house). However, chimneys had been a feature of urban life for centuries, and since population pressure and urbanisation were as great around 1300 as in 1550–1600, some additional factor must be at work. Estimating and comparing the heating degree days and growing degree days between these dates, based on historical temperature measurements and recent climate reconstructions for the British Isles, I propose that this factor was climate cooling. Climate affected both the demand and supply blades of the degree-day scissors. The estimated rise in heating degree days is comparable to replacing one month of summer (with no heating) with one month of winter (with maximal heating), while the decline in growing degree days similarly shortened the growing season for London’s supply area, weather only of fuel (Allen) or energy in general including food and feed (Malanima). Thus, while the immediate causes prompting the transition in the late 16th century may have been a general or, more likely, local population-resource crisis and/or rapid commercialisation, the long-term temperature decline between 1300 and 1600 meant that more domestic heating was needed to maintain thermal comfort at the later date, indeed, occasioning the very ‘invention of comfort’ (Crowley) itself. Over the even longer run, the combination of settled agriculture and waning interglacial temperatures made this invention almost inevitable at some time and place – historically it happened with the fossil energy transition in early modern England."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The economic principle for hauliers is simple: put as much load on a vehicle as possible. This formula was easy to understand when road transportation was based on horse-driven transport. Using one or two horses inherently limited the load’s weight. This situation changed with the motorised vehicle. Engineers could build engines with considerable power, and factories could deliver heavy lorries. Since the early 1900s, vehicle regulations have sought to strike a balance. On the one hand, hauliers desire to drive larger and, therefore, more profitable vehicles. On the other, authorities must protect roads from the heaviest and, therefore, most damaging traffic. Caught between these two forces, politicians must promote development prudently, such that they follow the industry’s wishes somewhat but also withstand the pressure to dedicate vast sums to increasing the carrying capacity of roads. The desire for larger vehicles, likely never to be satisfied, will continue to be met by technical improvements in both the carrying capacity of roads and the suspension system of vehicles, together with complex regulations adopted to manage this new technology. Historically, authorities’ politics were based on both knowledge and experiments. For the first many years of road regulation, practical engineers gained experience from their daily life. A scientific understanding of the effect and degradation of different road constructions grew slowly, and only after some costly experiments. This paper shows the interaction between road and vehicle technology, the scientific perception of road damage and the political attitudes toward laws and regulations. Taking examples from Danish legislation, the paper overviews the international research on road damage and the political discussion in international forums, including the EU administration. After World War II, it quickly became apparent that international road traffic would increase sharply. In response, the United Nations established an international standard for road traffic, including standards for width and axle load rules. Other common European standards were developed as well. In 1984, EEC adopted a directive on the load and dimensions of heavy goods vehicles. The most significant change was a decision that the countries would allow an axle weight of 11.5 tonnes beginning in 1992. However, there were also calls for further increases in weight limits, and work began on allowing vehicles of unique roadworthy construction to have their limits raised. Air-suspended vehicles were known to be relatively gentle on the roads, and the availability of other gentle suspension systems was investigated as well. To put these conditions into relief, this paper shows concrete transport prices from the first slow two-tonne trucks to today’s fast-moving 56-tonne vehicles. Implications for the transportation network organisation are discussed, including the former need for large warehouses and the present need for just-in-time distribution centres."

    "text": "The economic principle for hauliers is simple: put as much load on a vehicle as possible. This formula was easy to understand when road transportation was based on horse-driven transport. Using one or two horses inherently limited the load’s weight. This situation changed with the motorised vehicle. Engineers could build engines with considerable power, and factories could deliver heavy lorries. Since the early 1900s, vehicle regulations have sought to strike a balance. On the one hand, hauliers desire to drive larger and, therefore, more profitable vehicles. On the other, authorities must protect roads from the heaviest and, therefore, most damaging traffic. Caught between these two forces, politicians must promote development prudently, such that they follow the industry’s wishes somewhat but also withstand the pressure to dedicate vast sums to increasing the carrying capacity of roads. The desire for larger vehicles, likely never to be satisfied, will continue to be met by technical improvements in both the carrying capacity of roads and the suspension system of vehicles, together with complex regulations adopted to manage this new technology. Historically, authorities’ politics were based on both knowledge and experiments. For the first many years of road regulation, practical engineers gained experience from their daily life.

    "text": "Post-colonial Botswana’s rapid diamond-led economic growth (Hillbom & Bolt, 2018) has seen it catch-up and pull ahead of its Southern African neighbours, whose productive capacity was significantly higher halfway through the twentieth century. Similarly, before gaining independence in 1966 it also occupied a unique political space as a British protectorate in a region characterised by settler colonialism. The literature has argued that Southern Africa’s historically higher levels of economic development relative to the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa is tied to its unique form of colonialism. However, as an outlier in terms of colonial relations, Botswana’s economic history cannot be understood in the same manner. Thus, this paper studies the historical role of Botswanan political elites in determining the form of their integration into the British colonial system and subsequent post-colonial interactions with transnational mining capital.\nTo this end, the paper analyses two separate but interconnected historical junctures, and the politics that surrounds them. The first relates to the visit of three Batswana chiefs (Chiefs Khama, Bathoen and Sebele) to Britain in 1895 to lobby the state for protectorate status in response to an ever-encroaching British South Africa Company. Despite contemporary critics (eg. Morton & Ramsay, 2017) they, supported by missionaries and British teetotallers, won important concessions from the colonial state that were crucial to the form Bechuanaland’s colonial integration.\nThe second relates to negotiations between the De Beers diamond company and the new post-colonial Botswanan government in the 1970s. As I have argued previously (Loubser, 2021), scholars have overlooked the politics that underpin the very aggressive negotiations between the Botswanan and De Beers. The local economy’s sharing in Botswana’s booming diamond mines was not inevitable, but won through hard-fought negotiations. To analyse these two junctures the paper draws on archival sources based at the Kew National archives and British Library. The scope of analysis surrounds British colonial relations in the 1890s, De Beers’ prospects in the 1970s and Botswanan political elites’ constraints and actions in both periods.\nA vast body of literature shows that the form and nature of colonial rule must be taken into account when studying African developmental outcomes (Acemoglu et al., 2001, 2002; Acemoglu & Robinson, 2010; Cooper, 2002; Rodney, 1982). Scholars have differentiated between ‘labour reserve’, ‘cash crop’ and colonies of ‘the concession-owning companies’ to explain geographic variation (Amin, 1972). Austin (2010) identified the divergent development legacies of ‘settler’ and ‘peasant’ economies. In Southern Africa’s ‘settler economies’, settler groups suppressed and exploited black Africans in support of white agriculture, mining and manufacturing. However, while much of the literature often categorises Botswana as similar to its neighbours (eg. Mkandawire, 2010) – ‘settler economies’ – it sits awkwardly within this classification. This paper seeks to identify the ways in which Botswanan political elites have conditioned their country’s historical transformations by challenging ideas which have seen it as an extension of well-developed analytical frameworks imported from other Southern African countries.\nWords:479\nReference List Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., & Robinson, J.

    "text": "Convergence has been an exception since the Industrial Revolution. Rarer are the cases of divergence from the group of “rich” nations. Argentina’s experience is usually associated to falling behind when compared to other settler economies. The growth comparisons between these countries have been deeply documented (Frankema & Visker, 2011; Prados de la Escosura & Sanz-Villarroya, 2009; Sanz-Villarroya, 2005; Taylor, 1992). All in all, it seems that the Argentinian model displayed weaknesses already in the 19th century, it struggled to adapt to the shocks of the first half of the 20th century, and divergence intensified at the end of the century. Despite this large research agenda that focused on several dimensions of growth aspects, the role of economic shrinking has not been treated yet. Therefore, in this article we aim to analyze how economic shrinking behaved in these settler economies, and what were the main forces under it. For this purpose, we will put special attention in the dependence on external factors (mainly trade), the country economic structures, and its social endowments. Thus, we will emphasize the interaction between economic shrinking, external conditions, and social capabilities. We will look to the case of Argentina, in comparison to Australia, and Canada since 1880. All in all, we argue that Argentina’s relatively good performance during the First Globalization relied on positive international economic conditions. Moreover, the tailwinds of this period prevented the accomplishments of major economic and social reforms in the country. Consequently, when these conditions deteriorated, and disruptions of global trade took place, the country’s low social capabilities and the attempt to preserve the old growth regime prevented the transition to a new economic model. On the contrary, Australia and Canada managed to adapt to the changing circumstances. Thus, Argentina’s high shrinking tendencies could not be altered (while the other two countries managed to do so). With the help of the capability approach we will try to understand this shrinking story. While it is usually assumed that GDP per capita levels were similar in the three countries, Canada and Australia were remarkably different. The economic stagnation of Argentina during the 20th century would be less striking when these aspects are highlighted."

The paper combines parliamentary papers and the archival material from the agency tasked with managing the regulatory regime for mountain ranges to examine both the reasoning for regulation, and how it was implemented in practice.

    "text": "Previous research has stressed the limitations of using the historical censuses’ enumeration on women’s work, mainly concerning the fact that married women were by and large solely defined as housewives and their labor force participation was concealed. This consideration is primarily based off of research on the enumerations of main occupations, which was the most common occupational rubric in the national censuses. A few censuses, however, were particularly detailed, containing rubrics that may supplement our knowledge about women’s work. Such a census is the Swedish national census of 1930. It contains relatively hard to come by information on sideline occupations, income, and wealth, which can provide information on income-oriented work, beyond the housewife title. By analyzing the particularly rich information in the 1930 census in the general context of censuses’ typical limitations and objectives, this study explores “what do and don’t the censuses tell us about married women’s work?”. Answers to this question will rely on descriptive statistics that summarize the occupational and income enumerations, as well as methods that investigate the ways individual characteristics (e.g., socio-economic background, geographical background, educational level, age, etc.) were associated with having received various details on labor force participation. The paper contributes to existing research by nuancing the narrative of the censuses’ inadequate enumeration, by providing insight into the 1930 Swedish census and women’s work around 1930, and by enlightening future studies if having an occupation or income, or, rather, having this enumerated, was more typical for married women with certain characteristics."

    "text": "This paper provides an empirical analysis of skilled workers’ work careers in mining in Norway, 1787-1940. It seeks to give new insights into recruitment to mining and job switching within, to and from, this industry, which were at the time undergoing radical technological changes. With the aim of exploring the value of “practical (tacit) knowledge”, gained through work experience, the analysis shows that skilled workers (workers with formal education) frequently switched jobs throughout their career. This seemed to be an unusual long-lasting “tradition”. On the one hand, skilled workers switched easily between mining branches (silver, copper, iron etc.), in fact it was more common to switch between mining branches than within. On the other hand, they switched between mining branches and “technologically linked” sectors, notably mechanical workshops, energy sectors, the chemical industry and infrastructure. Although the reasons for job switching were many, it indicates that mining employers valued work experience which was closely related to their own, yet with certain different knowledge specialisations from which they could learn. Finally, many skilled workers with long working experience in the field ended their careers in public mining institutions. Thus, a significant share of “practical mining knowledge” ended up there. This supports the argument that the state played an active role in advancing the mining industry from early on, and throughout in this period."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Developmental states have historically played an important role in achieving industrialization that brings about better economic conditions at the national level. On the other hand, the labour and production process rely on unequal power relations between firms along the value chain, within the workplace, as well as between workers and the state. Focusing specifically on the textile and garment industry in Mauritius, this paper examines how state policies have played out and what the local implications have been for workers at the lower end of the chain. The overarching research question asks whether, and in what ways, the state’s interactions with firms and labour organizations and workers have created opportunities or constrained the development of an industry that is driven by social upgrading in Mauritius.\nThe paper first examines how and in what ways social upgrading, defined as an improvement in workers’ rights and conditions, has been considered in Mauritius’ state policy in the post-independence period up to present-day. Moreover, how have policies and firms responded to workers’ concerns and actions? The paper explores capital-labour relations, and specifically worker power, via interviews with senior policy makers, industrialists, labour union representatives and workers in and around the garment industry.\nFindings suggest that despite development of vertical integration and majority locally owned factories together with the implementation of a minimum wage and a discourse of inclusion and fairness, the Mauritian garment industry is struggling to renew itself and remains based on actor relationships that fosters marginalization and exploitation of labour. Labour is highly segmented in the industry along lines of gender, nationality, and migration status. Those firms that have survived the competitive landscape and expanded, have shifted toward more capital-intensive production. At the same time they have closely collaborated with the state in order to find new ways of accessing cheap labour. This has taken the form of employing disposable, migrant workers, predominantly men coming from Bangladesh, who since the 2000s have started making up increasingly large shares of the labour force on Mauritian factory floors. In parallel, the working conditions, including mandatory overtime in combination with lived experiences of sudden factory closures and relocation of the most labour-intensive garment manufacturing to Madagascar, as well as the emergence of employment alternatives in other economic sectors, make up some of the overlooked reasons for Mauritian labour shortages. In turn, these are shaped by historically contingent state-labour relations as well as interlinked spheres of capitalist production and social reproduction. At the same time, there appears to be evidence of worker power that has influenced the ways in which the Mauritian garment industry operates and which has translated into more developmentalist outcomes for all."

Due to endogeneity, there is however limited knowledge of the causal role of parental income and economic resources in this relationship. The aim of this study is to estimate the causal effect of incremental economic resources in childhood on educational, health and socioeconomic outcomes over the full life course in 20th century Sweden. It utilizes the introduction of the first cash-based child allowances in 1938, which targeted, among others, low-income widows with children. It uses longitudinal data from the Scanian Economic Demographic Database and applies a difference-in-differences method to derive causal results. Initial findings suggest that incremental income led to improvements in school performance in the short-term, but long-lasting effects on adulthood income or survival to old age are less clear. This is possibly due to incremental economic resources only affecting living conditions instantaneously, and fading off over time, but can also be explained by the size of the allowance, how the allowance was spent, for how long it was paid out and at what ages. Ongoing analyses explore additional adulthood economic and health outcomes as well as heterogeneities in the effects."

    "text": "There has been a long-lasting debate on the effect of enclosures on the agricultural development and output. It has been argued that enclosure facilitated land clearance and spurred the individual farmer to implement rational farming techniques, which consequently increased productivity. Whether this development increased the demand for labour in agricultural production or the opposite – made parts of the agricultural labour force redundant – has been at the heart of the international debate. In an agricultural society the balance between land (production) and population is very sensitive. The access to land is fundamental for how large the population can grow and be sustained within a given area; there has to be resources such as land and/or labour opportunities available or else population growth will be impossible. Ultimately, the question boils down to whether or not enclosure meant an increased opportunity for the population in the countryside to provide a source of income. If it freed enough resources for agriculture to expand and for more people to make a living for themselves. It has been argued that population pressure would lead to an increased demand on land, which in return would stimulate land clearance and land parcelling. Consequently, this would increase the demand for enclosures and the rationalisation of the scattered land strips. Enclosures in return would further stimulate land clearance and land parcelling, increasing the agricultural output further. This paper aims at studying whether this course of development is true for Uppsala County during the period of the three enclosure reforms (storskifte, enskifte and laga skifte) 1760-1900. By studying population growth and land parcelling in enclosed and unenclosed villages I hope to be able to answer whether enclosure actually led to an agricultural expansion in the region."

    "text": "Historical research has in recent years increased the efforts to quantify and clarify the female labor force participation. The task is made difficult by the fact that female labor force participation was often not reported in official sources. While there is no longer any doubt that most women worked and contributed to both the household and overall economy less is known about the dynamics of their labor force participation. Studies of this is also hampered by the lack of sources but it has been shown that women responded to market signals through wages both in the 19th (Horrell and Humphries 1995) and in the early 20th century (Hatton and Bailey 1993; Bean 2014). The women also responded to the incomes of their husbands by working less when the men earned more. To the extent that the women’s labor market participation was determined by the incomes of their men the women’s incomes can be said to have worked to shelter the households from income variations. Humphries (2010) instead suggests that it was the children’s work that sheltered the households from income variations. We investigate these issues using longitudinal household budget survey data collected in Sweden in the early 20th century (1913–1914). We can also follow all household incomes week by week over a full year. The research question is whether or not there was an effect on the labor force participation of women and children from short-term variations in male income."

We investigate these issues using longitudinal household budget survey data collected in Sweden in the early 20th century (1913–1914). We can also follow all household incomes week by week over a full year. The research question is whether or not there was an effect on the labor force participation of women and children from short-term variations in male income."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Towns and cities played a crucial role in early modern European economies, as centers of trade, administration and handicrafts. This paper uses probate inventories from three southern Swedish towns, Malmö, Ystad and Falkenberg, from the mid-1500s (Malmö), early 1600s (Ystad), or late 1600s (Falkenberg) to map the evolution of consumption and living standards in these towns until the 1860s. The probate inventories are comprehensive lists of goods held by the household of a deceased person; it was made mandatory to make an inventory in Sweden in 1734, but our archival research highlights that for a few towns, especially in what before 1658 was Denmark, plenty of inventories are preserved already from much earlier years. These list goods of various categories, including various metals, textiles, furniture, kitchen utensils, and items of art, which makes probate inventories a very fitting source for the study of consumer culture and material living standards. There is a social bias in that the more affluent segments of the towns’ populations will be best represented in the inventories, so our study will focus on traders, burghers, and artisans: those who owned enough goods to be probated already in the 1500s and 1600s. There is a growing economic history literature on market integration in the Baltic in the early modern period (e.g., Andersson and Ljungberg 2015; Marczinek, Maurer and Rauch 2022) and the list of goods in the probate inventories can address how connected inhabitants of south Swedish towns were to European markets. Previous research on seventeenth and eighteenth century probate inventories from Stockholm has focused on textiles (Aldman 2018; Andersson 2017) and this will be one of the type of goods that we look at, alongside the classical “consumption revolution” goods of tea, coffee, sugar and porcelain (cf. Shammas 1990; Ahlberger 1996; de Vries 2008; Rönnbäck 2010). Another line of research has focused on the great merchants, also using probate inventories (Müller 1998). Our study also connects to the debate, based on GDP per capita estimates (Edvinsson 2013) or real wages (Gary 2018), on early modern living standards and economic growth in Sweden. Compared to the study of great merchants on the one hand, and labourers on the other, our study promises to add more fine-grained information about consumption capacity and living standards among the middling sort, in between the extremes of the social hierarchy. By shedding light on this group, we will also be able to discuss the role of towns in the Scandinavian economies in this period, and the degree of trade integration"

We show that, on top of the violent and legal means available to masters, the specific remuneration of the servant institution was yet another instrument in the bundle of coercive practices that characterized the institution, an instrument which exhibited an astonishing continuity from medieval times up until the end of the nineteenth century.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper investigates intergenerational wealth accumulation in a sample of Swedish noble families over a period spanning from the mid-18th century to the early 20th century. Drawing on probate inventories, it provides insights into the financial strategies of the nobility, including investment and inheritance practices, as well as the management of a variety of assets over time. The research contributes to the literature focused on intergenerational wealth transfer and inequalities. In particular, it studies the evolution of wealth concentration and inequalities of opportunities among the top wealthiest noble families in a crucial phase in the Swedish history. The 19th century was a period of vast economic and political transformation, which resulted in a growing disparity in prestige and financial status among two different groups of nobles. The high nobility became increasingly agricultural, while the low one moved to the urban areas and converged, in their lifestyle and economic behavior, with the wealthy bourgeoisie. This paper focuses on a sample of Swedish families chosen among the top richest in 1900, and it first studies their genealogical trees from mid-18th century to the early 20th century. Then, it relies on probate inventories to study how wealth was acquired and managed over time both qualitatively and quantitatively, comparing different families as well as various branches of the same families. The research aims to answer several questions, including the role of factors such as inheritance, investments, marriages, education, and professional careers in the process of accumulation or dissipation of wealth. What distinguishes families or branches that became richer from those that did not? Was the process predetermined or did individuals, generation after generation, shape their own destiny and that of their family? Compared to the existing literature, this paper does not consider single individuals at specific time frames, but it studies the probate inventories of all the members of specific families, generation after generation. This approach allows us to: a) highlight intrafamily dynamics; b) compare how different branches of the same family manage the wealth they inherited; c) limit problems associated with intervivos gifts and other transfers of wealth that happened when individuals were still alive, and, therefore, were not listed in probate inventories. By shifting the focus from individuals to families, this research provides new insights into the role of inheritance in intergenerational wealth accumulation. Moreover, it offers a new perspective on how the Swedish aristocracy coped with the significant economic and social changes that characterize this time period."

    "text": "Outbreaks of bubonic plague initiated by the flea-borne bacterium Yersinia pestis have repeatedly afflicted the Old World since the onset of the “Justinian Plague” in 541 AD. The second European pandemic, the “Black Death” rapidly killed around half of the population during 1347-1353 AD. Both pandemics then persisted with recurrent local outbreaks over several centuries. The threat from the plague bacillus, which still induces several thousand human cases annually, may well increase under projected climate change. The last major plague in France, the famous “plague of Marseilles”, started in this coastal city and occurred between 1720 and 1722 AD across the South East of France and the Massif Central. The epidemic lasted 31 months and killed about 120.000 people, 240 communities were contaminated. Deaths were not evenly distributed across regions, with some areas affected very little while others were all but entirely depopulated. This was the case for Marseilles with about 50.000 deaths which was frequently called “the dead city”. However, short and long-term global socio-economic impacts of this devastating historical plague outbreak as well as the specific resilience in both the urban and rural populations are not yet fully understood. Understanding how communities respond to abrupt population decline is a key element in both debates about collapse and the identification of putative drivers of social and environmental transformation. A number of quite different outcomes are possible. The plagues of the historical period provide effective case studies of sudden population reduction. Here, we explore the short-term and long-term effects of this epidemic on human populations across the Southeastern France. They include a series of various biological, social, economic, political and religious upheavals which could have profound effects on the course of regional, but also national, history throughout the 18th century. This analysis is a reflection of how the society responded to depopulation - thanks to an adaptive response - with a scaling back of their economy, agriculture, conservation of core functionality, and entrenchment of the established order."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Renewable energy systems are often thought of as alternatives to fossil fuels. A historical view, however, reveals that different energy systems tend to co-evolve, with incumbent energy constellations shaping the emerging ones. In this paper, I will examine the role of established fossil fuel business constellations in the development of renewable alternatives by looking at the case of oil and geothermal energy in Iceland and California, which both became leaders in geothermal heating and power development in the 1960s and 1970s. While fundamentally different in end use, geothermal and hydrocarbon industries employ similar methods for exploring and extracting fluids and gases out of the earth. Those similarities induced oil companies to enter the geothermal business, and geothermal pioneers to seek cooperations with the oil industry, whereas the business models and practices of oil and geothermal development were deeply intertwined. The volcanically active region of Greater California (U.S. and Mexico), with power plant complexes at The Geysers, Imperial Valley and Cerro Prieto, became a hot spot for geothermal development in the 1960s and still holds one fourth of the world’s geothermal power capacity. Those projects were largely implemented by oil companies – Pure Oil, Union Oil and Chevron – which set up geothermal divisions and acquired start-ups. Oil companies provided the necessary funding for high-risk exploration drilling and applied their expertise to explore and exploit geothermal energy with geoscientific exploration techniques, oilwell rotary drilling and reservoir engineering. Around the same time, Iceland became a leader in geothermal use, as public utility companies built geothermal power plants and district heating utilities all around the island. As a result, geothermal energy provides for the heating of 9 out of 10 houses and almost one-third of the electricity supply today. Unlike California, Iceland never had an oil industry. Even so, petroleum technologies and geoscientific expertise were crucial to Iceland’s transition from oil to geothermal energy, as exploration and exploitation methods were learned from the oil industry. In both cases, the businesses of oil and geothermal energy have been deeply intertwined, not only via expertise and technologies, but also via business models and practices. In California, oil companies sold steam to electric utilities at prices linked to fossil fuels, which made the geothermal business highly profitable in the 1970s. Similar to oil companies, Icelandic geothermal companies employed the business model of charging geothermal tariffs linked to oil prices, which guaranteed a return on investment and allowed to pay off drilling and infrastructure loans. Based on archival research in the U.S. and Iceland, and employing the concepts of socio-technical systems and “oil spillovers”, I adopt a comparative perspective on Iceland and California. As I will argue, we need to look beyond single energy carriers and examine the co-evolution of historical energy systems. My case studies reveal the links and hybridization between fossil fuels and renewables, or oil and renewable energy businesses, and complicate standard notions of energy transitions from one energy carrier to another."

As I will argue, we need to look beyond single energy carriers and examine the co-evolution of historical energy systems. My case studies reveal the links and hybridization between fossil fuels and renewables, or oil and renewable energy businesses, and complicate standard notions of energy transitions from one energy carrier to another."

The paper will largely form the basis of my dissertation plan and is part of the session “The Neoliberal Shift”.\nThe project sets out to investigate the transformation of the Swedish labor market since the onset of de-industrialization and the rise of neoliberalism. My focus lies on how policy-makers responded to what I will refer to as the ‘underemployment dilemma’. The term underemployment is usually applied in the field of economics to account for the difference between the hours people would like to work and the actual hours worked. The prime example is a part-time worker who is unable to get a full-time position. The understanding of underemployment I depart from is slightly different, referring instead to a structurally induced difficulty to create stable employment; a development that started with de-industrialization. The symptoms of underemployment as opposed to unemployment, however, is not that workers are generally out of work. Underemployment instead takes the expression of insecure, badly paid, bullshit jobs, often in the form of temporary or part-time contracts swallowed by the less productive service sector.\nIn the United States, in which most of the literature on the transformation of labor and its relation to inequality have been conducted, the growth in low-productivity service sector jobs has been significant. Sweden has seen a different trajectory, creating other sorts of restrains on its economy. Already in the 1990s, political economists noted that the shift from manufacturing to services had created new difficulties for policy-makers pursuing full employment and egalitarian wages. The new ‘service economy trilemma’ forced policy-makers to choose only two out of three goals: egalitarian wage-setting, employment growth in the public sector, or budget restraints. Complicating rather than contradicting this story, I want to investigate the multitude and often ‘innovative’ responses to the new low-demand for labor economy in Sweden, moving beyond the alternatives of the above. The primary dilemma, as I see it, is one between a political economic (social democratic) system that works from the ideal of full employment and one in which firms are decreasingly capable of creating that employment. How policy-makers chose to respond to this dilemma is a story that still unfolds, but the early pursuit of neoliberal objectives clearly marked the beginning of it.\nIn short, I take underemployment dilemma to play a significant role in the political economic development of the neoliberal age. Yet, few studies have adopted this perspective as a starting-point for their analysis of neoliberal reform. Political scientists have tended to focus on ideational change among experts, elites, and institutions. Among critical political economists, on the other hand, underemployment is often sweepingly applied to diagnose the current stage of capitalism, but little attention has been paid to the role that it has played in shaping the political economic development. Hence, by tracing rather than assuming the responses to the low-demand economy, I hope to shed new light on the transformation of the Swedish labor market and its intimate relationship to the rise of neoliberalism."

The results further show that the homelands have caused long-run population density to double and that homelands-specific erosive agricultural practices have reduced contemporary topsoil quality. In an economic history background analysis, I highlight the role of the following as likely causes of the contemporary pattern of spatial inequality: the limited size of the homelands, denaturalization, the migrant labour system, parent absenteeism, Apartheid rural policy (including ‘influx control’ and ‘Betterment’), ‘Native Law’, Bantu education, and property dispossession.

    "text": "An often overlooked aspect of the neoliberal shift within the Swedish national context is the process of corporatization of public enterprises. Corporatization was a decades-long, gradual process, starting with formalization in 1911 and its culmination in the early 1990s as the Swedish ‘affärsverk’ (public enterprises) –specific types of “business-like” government authorities– went from being a public agency to being a state-owned enterprise. As such, the corporatization of the ‘affärsverk’ is a key part of this shift towards market orientation.\nThe research presented will be focused around a critical juncture in the historical trajectories of the ‘affärsverk’: The government official inquiry into the public enterprises - the enterprise leadership committee (‘verkledningskommitén’) that was initiated in 1983 and delivered its two final reports in 1985. These reports were then developed into a legislative proposal and accepted in 1987. This proposal officially granted the Affärsverk results-based, corporate governance structures (Berg, 1999). This marked the “last gasp” and a distinct market oriented shift in the organizational and regulatory structure of the ‘affärsverk’, however it did not entail full corporatization.\nBecause of their structure, the affärsverk were part market overseer and regulator, part market actor and part creator of markets. Often acting as both regulator and participant in the very same market. In addition, each of these organizations arose from specific historical circumstances (Waara, 1980). The structures governing ‘affärsverk’ were often unclear and non-uniform. This gave the individual affärsverk varying levels of discretion depending on the specific regulatory rules that governed each organization. As such, there was considerable tension between the structures governing the affärsverk and agency in terms of managerial discretion within each affärsverk. It is therefore of interest to bring further understanding to how and to what extent management attempted to utilize this agency to influence their own regulatory structures by partaking in the policy process leading to the major reform in 1987 to this end, verkledningskommittén provides an intriguing subject of study.\nAs an entry point, Berg (1999) explicitly mentions that the internal perspective of the Affärsverk has not yet been covered extensively. Our research will fill this gap as we will utilize archival material from ‘verkledningskommittén’, in addition to board- and management minutes as well as to internal strategic reports from the different affärsverk archives (with the exception of FFV)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The failure of many countries in the Global South to catch up economically to the advanced economies of the Global North has long been a topic of interest to economic historians and development economists. Traditionally, researchers focused their attention on the question of growth –how can a country achieve growth to catch up? In recent years, however, a new research programme has begun to shift attention away from the question of economic growth to the question of how to avoid economic shrinking. This new strand of research shows that countries that have caught up did not experience significantly higher average growth rates in comparison to laggard countries. Instead, what sets them apart is their resilience to economic shrinking, i.e., that they have experienced fewer and less severe episodes in which annual GDP per capita growth was negative (Andersson 2018; Broadberry & Wallis 2016). A crucial factor identified as a determinant of increased resilience to economic shrinking has been identified as the set of social capabilities a country possesses, specifically transformation, inclusion, autonomy, and accountability (Andersson & Palacio 2017). It has also been hypothesised that the financial and monetary system play a key role in determining a country’s resilience to shrinking. This paper sets out to investigate the relationship between financial and monetary sector development in Kenya and Tanzania and their resilience to shrinking, focusing specifically on the aspects of central bank autonomy and accountability, which are important determinants of central bank performance (Lybek 2008). We find that, between 1960 and 2020, both Kenya and Tanzania experienced frequent shrinking episodes – on average once every four years in Kenya and once every 3.5 years in Tanzania, which significantly impacted their overall growth trajectory. These episodes were not distributed evenly over the sixty-year period, however, with Kenya experiencing shorter episodes of shrinking spaced out over the entire period, while Tanzania saw its shrinking episodes concentrated in the period of 1973-1994. This led to Tanzania falling behind Kenya from the 1970s onwards but catching up and converging since the mid-1990s. We also find a clear link between monetary sector reforms and central bank autonomy and accountability and the shrinking pattern in the two countries. The Kenyan central bank has had only limited autonomy since its inception and been held accountable primarily to the wishes of the Kenyan president instead of the overall country or national economy, as indicated by frequent and politically motivated changes in central bank governorship. In Tanzania, the central bank’s autonomy was initially likewise limited and the Tanzanian government tried to use the central bank as an active agent in the country’s development, resulting in the prolonged period of shrinking beginning in 1973. However, the second Bank of Tanzania Act of 1996 led to significant changes in the relationship between central bank and government, increasing the central bank autonomy, shifting accountability towards the general economy, and contributing to the absence of shrinking since."

    "text": "A fundamental feature of major banking crises in economic history is the closure of banks (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009; Grossman, 2010; Jalil, 2015). A classic example is the Great Depression, when more than 9,000 banks suspended in the United States between 1930 and 1933 (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963, p. 35). According to Bernanke (1983), bank closures result in lost expertise, information, and relationships, which increases the cost of credit intermediation and decreases the volume of credit and economic activity. In many historical episodes, however, there are confounding factors that obscure a clean estimate of the macroeconomic effects of bank closures, such as weak fundamentals, panics, lending of last resort, and bail outs.\nAn ideal experiment would observe two identical islands. In the first, banks would be closed; in the second, banks would be open. The difference in economic outcomes between the first and second island is equal to the causal effect of bank closures. While this randomised control trial is impossible, there was a natural experiment in history: Ireland in the 1960s and 1970s. All banks were closed between 7 May and 30 July 1966, 1 May and 17 November 1970, and 28 June and 6 September 1976, due to industrial disputes (Murphy, 1978). While there has been general interest in this episode (Financial Times, 2015; Independent, 2015), there has been little academic research.\nTo estimate the unobserved counterfactual Ireland with open banks, we use synthetic control methods (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003; Abadie et al., 2010, 2015; Born et al., 2019). To do so, we construct a doppelganger that is a weighted average of countries in the donor pool, where the weights are determined by minimising the distance in outcomes between actual and doppelganger Ireland before treatment. The causal effect is the difference in outcomes after treatment.\nOur hypothesis is that the complete closure of banks involved a significant economic contraction. However, it was not a macroeconomic disaster, as agents substituted away from the scarce resource – bank credit – to other forms, such as cheques and micro credit, which ameliorated the impact. This is consistent with recent research showing that substitution after sudden stops is an important macroeconomic shock absorber (Bachmann et al., 2022)."

Avlönat hushållsarbete skilde sig på många vis från det som vanligtvis räknas till arbetarklassyrken – kvinnorna som tog anställning bodde i regel i sin arbetsgivares hem, hade oreglerad fritid och arbetstid vilket innebar långa och slitsamma arbetsdagar, och lydde under en stor del av tidsperioden under föråldrad lagstiftning. Trots yrkesgruppens numerära omfattning och kulturella betydelse finns det mycket vi inte vet om den, arbetet och yrkesutövarna i en svensk kontext. I avhandlingen Frun tillhanda: Avlönat hushållsarbete 1890–1939 är syftet att studera det avlönade hushållsarbetets praktiker och hierarkier, för att bidra till kunskapsläget gällande arbetes- och klassrelationer mellan kvinnor. I avhandlingen studeras hushållsarbetets olika grupper och dess benämningar och yrkestitlar, arbetsdelningen i hushållet och hur klass skapades, upprätthölls och bröts ned under en tid av omfattande samhällelig förändring. Klass definieras här som något som görs, med kroppen, språket och med inslag av materiell kultur, den fysiska livsvärlden och ekonomiska förutsättningar, och som påverkar människors tillgång till materiella och kulturella resurser. Därtill är det teoretiska ramverket inspirerat av Butlers teorier om performativa praktiker, och Gender and Works forskning om arbete i tidigmodern tid. Det huvudsakliga källmaterialet för avhandlingen består av två materialkorpusar: cirka 13 000 jobbannonser från Dagens Nyheter, skrivna av både arbetsgivare och hushållsarbetare, och svar på Nordiska Museets frågelista nummer 189: Tjänarinneyrket från 1967. Annonsmaterialet erbjuder insikt i vilka yrkestitlar och benämningar som fanns, vilka sorters arbetsuppgifter och yrkeskvalifikationer dessa kopplades ihop med, vilka personliga och kroppsliga egenskaper som lyftes som viktiga, och hur hushållsarbetarna och arbetsgivarna förhandlade sina relationer i rekryteringsprocessen. Därtill fungerar annonserna som avhandlingens kronologiska röda tråd, och annonser från en vecka för varje år för tidsperioden har samlats in och analyserats. Frågelistsvaren, där både före detta arbetsgivare och hushållsarbetare beskriver sina erfarenheter av yrket, erbjuder en inblick i vardagens praktiker, de dagliga rutinerna och sysslorna, samt berättar om hushållets konflikter och relationer.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The transmission of wealth is a matter that has long been central to the debate over inequality and its impact on society. Theoretical models of inequality predict the consolidation of wealth into an elite group, along with its persistence in the long-run, generation after generation (Bourguignon 1981). Several authors have shown how elite often introduce mechanisms reinforcing inequality all the while influencing, or holding, power (e.g., Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Amsden, DiCaprio, and Robinson 2012; Lenski 2013; Ager 2013). Within this context, recent scholarship has demonstrated the key role that shocks of different sorts – wars, plagues, and institutional crisis – have in affecting elite persistence through slowing down, if not temporarily reversing, the process of wealth consolidation and its impact on power (e.g., Piketty 2014; Alfani 2015; Scheidel 2017; Atkinson 2018). Albeit long-term evidence on elite persistence and intergenerational wealth transmission is growing for developed countries in the Western world (e.g., Clark and Cummins 2015; Atkinson 2018; Black et al. 2020), little is known for other territories. This is especially problematic when it comes to societies renowned for being highly unequal. One such case is that of former slave-based plantation societies in the Caribbean. These territories are deemed among the most unequal societies in the past, and remain among the most unequal in current days (Caribbean Development Bank 2016). However, aggregate inequality levels can hide patterns of wealth transmission and elite persistence, especially in the face of major shocks. The present paper examines the research question ‘How did intergenerational wealth transmission and elite persistence develop in slave-based sugar plantation societies in the West Indies in the long-run?’ relying on the case study of the Danish West Indies – current-days American Virgin Islands. The study takes a long-term perspective, spanning the mid-eighteenth century to the early-twentieth century. This timeframe consents to study long-term developments in intergenerational wealth transmission and elite formation and the impact that major shocks and threats – Napoleonic Wars, slave trade abolition and emancipation, competition from sugar beet – had on wealth transmission and elite persistence. The study relies on a novel dataset compiled from tax registers and census data for the whole population of the territory under examination. The dataset contains most, if not all, of the assets that made up wealth in slave-based plantation societies: real estate, agricultural land, slaves, and other buildings along with the prices they fetched on the market, upon which the study relies to estimate wealth at the household-head level. Information on demographics, along with names and geographic location, are employed to link individuals over time and to identify heirs across generations. Based upon this information, the paper studies different aspects of intergenerational transmission of wealth and its persistence, including 1) the profile of individuals belonging within the top percentiles over time and their role within society; 2) the effect of shocks on intergenerational transmission of wealth and on elite persistence. Descriptive and inferential statistics, in the form of rank regression, are employed for the purpose of the paper."

    "title": "Electricity as a skill-biased technology: Evidence from Sweden during early 20th century",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At the turn of the 20th century, electricity was the new general-purpose technology transforming economies across Europe and North America. Thanks to electricity, industrial production increased and extended to new products and markets. The transition from steam to small electric motors made it possible to redesign factories so as to improve workflows and to slash the costs of real capital. Electricity also paved the way for more sophisticated production methods. Goldin and Katz (1998) argue that the emergence of electricity marked the beginning of the so-called technology-skill complementarity, as the production methods enabled by safer and more stable source of power increased the demand for educated blue-collar workers, such as operators and machine-repairers. Electrification also reduced the need for unskilled workers at the factory floor carrying fuel to the machines and semi-finished goods from one machine to another. Furthermore, the larger production units enabled by electricity also increased the demand for managers and office clerks, which were typical white-collar occupations. The influential argument of Goldin and Katz (1998) about electricity and the technology-skill complementarity has, however, not been explored with establishment-level data. In this paper, we test the Goldin-Katz hypothesis in the context of Sweden at the early 20th century. We draw on two public investigations into manufacturing industry that offers establishment-level data for 1913, 1918 and 1926, which is a time frame that captures the heyday of Swedish electrification. The original returns of the investigations that we have digitized offers a unique opportunity to study the relationship between electricity and skills. We test the hypothesis that increased use of electricity is associated with increased employment of skilled relative to unskilled workers."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Technological change takes place spasmodically, as research demonstrates; a commonly shared view among economic historians is that a few sets of specific technologies, coined GPTs, have had the most far-reaching impact on economic development (Bresnahan & Trajtenberg 1995). Most authors agree that electricity deserves the epithet of a GPT. The introduction of electricity, and in particular the use of small electric motors, did away with the shafts, pulleys and belts that criss-crossed the factory hall. Instead of being propelled by a single source of motive power through line shafts and countershafts, each machine was run by a small electric motor. The growing use of unit drive facilitated a complete reconfiguration of the factory. The operation of the factory now required less manual workers. Besides reducing the demand for manual labour, unit drive entailed several indirect savings, such as increased flow of production, improved working environments, improved machine control and ease of plant expansion.\nThe transition from steam to electricity was rapid in the US, in particular during WWII. Much of the remarkably rapid growth of total factor productivity in manufacturing during the 1920s probably stemmed from the benefits that could be reaped from electrification (Field 2006). Because electrification occurred across the board of industries, we could perhaps expect that productivity advances across industries be similar. A way to test this notion is to deploy the Harberger’s distinction between yeast and mushroom-like patterns of productivity growth rates: he labelled an even pattern yeast-like and an uneven pattern mushroom-like. David and Wright (2003) argue that productivity growth rates became yeast-like in the 1920s and 1930s as the advantages of electricity came to fruition.\nIn Sweden, though, electrification proceeded even faster. Prado (2014) argues that the uniform productivity pattern that manifested itself in the first decade of the twentieth century owed to electrification. Before the turn of the century, productivity advances were largely mushroom-like because steam never had the potential to foster productivity growth rates across large swathes of the manufacturing sector. Prado’s investigation ends in 1912, however, coinciding with the end of the old version of the industrial statistics. To confirm the truth of his conjecture – that electricity was responsible for the unified productivity growth patterns in the first decade of the twentieth century – would require us to examine the interwar years, when electrification accelerated, first, and then came to an end when all manufacturing processes were run by electric motors in the end of the 1930s.\nTherefore, in this paper we will attempt to continue the search for productivity advances and electrification in the interwar years. We do so by drawing on a sample of sixty industries in 1913–1950, combining the volume output series of Johansson (1985) and various issues of Board of Trade, and employment and other variables from the Swedish Industrial Statistics. We use the Harberger metaphor of yeast versus mushroom to identify whether electricity had the qualities of a true GPT. We then apply panel data econometrics to establish the impact of electricity on productivity advances."

Utvecklingen i hela den svenska skogsindustrin präglades särskilt under 1950- och 1960-talen av hårdare internationell konkurrens som i sin tur drev fram ökad koncentration, ny produktionsteknik, samt stordriftsproduktion med större kapitalinsats. För att hantera konkurrensen har de små köpsågverken försökt organisera sina intressen för att framför allt påverka utbudet av och prisnivnå på råvaran. Vi vill beskriva och analysera hur köpsågverk i framför allt Norr- och Västerbotten samarbetat inom ramen för den svenska skogsindustrins utveckling mot mer kapitalintensiv produktion och en allt starkare koncentration av verksamheterna.\nVi fokuserar de regionala intresseorganisationerna ABSI och SÅGAB, var arkiv vi fått tillgång till. De flesta ärenden som behandlats av styrelsen för ABSI och senare SÅGAB under perioden från 1970-talet fram till i dag har handlat om hur sågverken ska säkra tillgång till sågtimmer och hur prisnivåerna ska beräknas och fastställas. I detta sammanhang har även statsmakten spelat en stor roll. Den svenska virkesmarknaden var under lång tid uppdelad i prisområden, där Västerbotten ingick i ett prisområde tillsammans med övriga norrlandslän. Handeln med sågtimmer var reglerad genom att köparna genom sina karteller förhandlade med säljarna via skogsägarföreningarna om priset inom respektive område. Detta kunde ske eftersom skogsägarföreningarna var bundna till sina givna geografiska områden och inte fick arbeta utanför dessa. Tanken var att prisområdena och prisförhandlingarna skulle bidra till att lösa två problem, dels att åstadkomma rimliga och stabila prisnivåer på sågtimmer, dels att främja planerbarhet i tillgång till sågtimret, eftersom avverkning ibland behövde uppmuntras oavsett prisbild, särskilt när det gällde små privata skogsägare. En händelse som påverkade virkesmarknaden på ett mer djupgående sätt inträffade 1993, när Sverige skulle bli medlem i EU och behövde anpassa sin konkurrenslagstiftning.

The state in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa has functioned as the largest employer of the wage-earning population, and the expansion of the public sector has been particularly remarkable since independence. This type of development has an important drawback. Previous research suggests that as the state promoted the creation of a complex bureaucracy, it discouraged the development of private indigenous enterprise.\nIn Kenya, the public sector constituted 46% of all wage employment outside agriculture in the year 1966, while private sector employment stagnated from the 1960s to the 1970s (Vinnai, 1974). Kenya as a case study is of particular interest due to the relatively large settler population and the comparatively extensive administrative apparatus as well as the consecutive Africanization of this sector. The majority of the Kenyan post-independence elites could, indeed, be found in state employment (Simson, 2017). Tracing down the historical development and growth of the public sector in relation to the private sector is, thus, the main objective of this study with the additional aim of providing a more dynamic picture of the public sector actors.\nThe public-private differentials are taken as a departure point into a more thorough exploration of the public sector. The dynamics between the private and public sectors in colonial times are only narrowly explored, although the disparities in employment and remuneration between the two have been previously noted (Collier & Lal, 1986; Bigsten, 1987; Kilson, 1970). Going from a situation at the beginning of the colonial period in Kenya when the public sector would tend not to compete with the private sector in order to keep wages down (van Zwanenberg, 1975), to the public sector employing most of the educated and highly paid workers in the late 1960s, testifies to a shift in the dynamics. Thus, analysing the dynamics between the two sectors is important for understanding the development of the economy and the opportunities provided for African labour in the formal wage sector of Kenya.\nThis study finds considerable disparities between public and private sector employment and remuneration, which over time, however, seem to diminish. Additionally, differentiation within the public sector is detected. The paper contributes to the understanding of historical public-private differentials in Kenya as well as to the comprehension of the growing importance of the public sector."

    "text": "In this paper, I use a new plant-level dataset to investigate the relationship between wages and the regional strength of unions. Using a shift-share or ’Bartik’ instrumental variables approach, I disentangle the causal effect of union strength on wage levels. I find statistically and economically significant, heterogeneous union wage effects for men with the bottom of the distribution being impacted by union density and the top two-thirds being unaffected. I find a negative effect around the median for women and argue that unions, in general, were uninterested in the issues for women and were organizations mostly for men, by men. The paper contributes to the literature by providing the only evidence of a union wage effect in Sweden and, perhaps, the earliest union wage effect found anywhere–highlighting the importance of unions in shaping labor market outcomes in the early 20th century and showing that union wage effects have to be understood in their historical context."

    "title": "Innovation networks during the French industrialization – Working with historical text data at scale",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Although women have been actively involved in economic activities throughout the industrialization period (e.g., Boserup, 1970; Goldin, 1990), their contributions to technological progress and innovation activity during this period have yet to be further investigated. Previous studies provided partial evidence that women innovated during the nineteenth century (Chanteux, 2009; Khan, 2016). Women patented in diverse industries and have been involved in patenting activities since the inception of the patenting system in France and throughout the entirety of the nineteenth century (Merouani and Perrin, 2023). Innovation studies have long recognized the role of networks in the innovation process, and are especially useful when analyzed through a dynamic perspective and coupled with geographic information (Boschma and Frenken, 2010). Typically, economic historians have viewed networks related to technological innovation as either structures through which technological innovation diffuses or as links between ideas that define the lineage of innovation (Esteves and Geisler Mesevage, 2019). While there are some studies on the role of social networks in facilitating the process of invention and innovation (e.g., Cook, 2011) – these are few. The existence of a significant and persistent gender patenting gap and a lower propensity for women to patent in teams, as shown by Merouani and Perrin (2023), poses intriguing questions on the role of social networks in innovation. Why are some individuals or networks better connected than others? Does connectivity increase the innovativeness of individuals? What is more important for innovation, connectivity or proximity? But more importantly: To what extent do social networks facilitate or hinder innovation? Although not all innovations are patented, patenting activity as a means of measuring innovation has become a standard practice for making comparisons across time and between countries (Moser, 2016). In this paper, I use a dynamic social network analysis approach with a novel and complete patent dataset of 19th century French patents developed by Merouani and Perrin (2023). Following the work by Moser (2005), I complement this database with other forms of innovations by including innovators acting outside the patenting system by using information from fairs in 19th century France (e.g., Exposition universelle de Paris de 1889). Preliminary findings show that networks of both men and women were especially concentrated in large cities. Networks including female innovators had less connectivity with mediators (e.g., patent agents), which are an integral part of the national network. Further, I find that institutions such as the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers [Conservatory of arts and trades] in Paris acted as large central nodes to attract and develop networks of innovators from all over France. These findings do not include the results of the study’s primary analyses, which are still being conducted."

It is widely attended by PhD candidates as well as established researchers. As in Gothenburg in 2021, this meeting is jointly organized as an All-Nordic conference. We hope that the conference will attract broad international participation.\nThe conference mainly consists of parallel working panels composed around proposals from contributors and prospective attendants from all over Scandinavia. A wide range of subject matters will be discussed. There will also be keynote presentations and special opportunities for doctoral students to present their thesis projects. Moreover, there will be administrative meetings for Heads of Departments and Director of studies, and for the national and Scandinavian Economic history associations.\n\nRegistration dates\nOnline registration will open in January 2023.\n\n\n\nPropose a session\nYou can propose a session here until the 1st of February 2023.\n\n\nSubmit an abstract\nPaper submission will open in mid December 2022.\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\nWhat is the fast track publication process like?\nThe Scandinavian Economic History Review is offering the possibility for participants at the conference to submit their papers for fast track consideration for publication. All contributions should be based on original research and will be subject to the normal peer-review process. Please remember to note that you are submitting for the fast track when you apply for the conference. Interested authors will be required to submit a full version through the SEHR online submission platform two weeks before the conference at the latest. The papers will be subject to an initial review by the SEHR editors.\nAccepted papers will be presented at separate “fast track sessions”, where an SEHR editor will be present and provide feedback on your work. The authors of the very best submissions will be invited to revise their papers based on these comments within three weeks, and the resubmissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process, with an initial decision made by the end of January 2024. Please note, that the fast track does not in any way preclude other papers from being submitted to the Review.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact us here"

    "text": "The railway is one of the innovations that has influenced modern social development the most. When the first main lines began to be built in Sweden during the mid-19th century, cultivation was an integral component of the railway system, comprising aesthetic gardens, protective cultivation, and kitchen gardens. Despite the large areas and resources this cultivation demanded, our current knowledge about why gardens were established, and when attitudes towards them began to change, is surprisingly limited.\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss the results from my PhD-thesis “The State as Gardener: Railway Cultivation from the Art of Improving Nature to Bequest” (2022), with the purpose to analyse and discuss the events and ideals that characterised the rise and fall of the gardening organisation of the Swedish State Railways. Chronologically the study includes two key periods: the construction phase of 1855–1875 and the decline phase of 1955–1975. Archive material has been located by using the railway’s organisational system as a starting point. The method used to analyse archive material and published sources has consisted of text analysis, inspired by discourse perspectives and the theory of path dependence. With the concepts of modernity and place as points of departure, this paper discusses how the transition, from gardens being fundamental to the railway system to their being phased out from the organisation, can be understood and explained.\nGardens were among the perceived benefits of railways, where they played a key role when new places were created alongside the lines. During the construction phase of 1855–1875, railway gardens were characterised by the ideal of “the art of improving nature” (naturförsköningskonsten) and that of nation-building. The organisation and coordination of gardening, including for example plant nurseries and gardeners, was a fundamental railway activity. During the decline phase of 1955–1975, a performance-based realignment led to a focus on rationalisation and economic cutbacks. Post-war ideals of modernisation, a new rail policy, road transport and an increased emphasis on urgency all contributed to the declining role of the railways. Structure, order, aesthetics, progress and education were no longer expressed in the same way through gardens. Many places changed. Arenas where people once spent time now became areas to simply pass through.\nHow ideals influenced material expression, and the factors considered conducive for modernity, are discussed in the paper. Nineteenth-century industrial modernity provided the impetus for railway gardens. High modernity in the second half of the 20th century led to initial downsizing and eventually, in 1973 to the closure of the nurseries and revised tasks for the gardeners. Prior to the latter changes, “wills” were drawn up: assessments of existing gardens that were used to bequeath responsibility from a central to a local level. These changes in the State organisation and structures are also discussed in the paper."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 20th century generally saw a trend of industrial concentration, and the beer markets were no exception. Indications from the US beer market point towards increased market concentration in the medium run (Greer, 1971). Concentration was partly driven by an increased will of antitrust authorities to allow already large brewing companies to merge with one another (such as Miller and Coors) to form mega-companies (Elzinga, 2011). The effect of mergers has also been an aspect of the British brewing industry, although not on the same scale as in the American case (Slade, 2004). The concentration trend was a distinct feature even in the proud Belgian beer market, where the number of breweries decreased from over 3000 to around 100 across the 20th century, and average brewery size increased twenty-fold (Swinnen & Briski, 2017). In contrast, the German market was notably less concentrated than the two Anglo-Saxon and the Belgian, having partly to do with the fact that beer consumption had clear regional dimensions, creating several large regional producers with similar shares in the national market as a whole (Adams, 2011).\nIn Sweden, the brewery sector went from being large and lively before World War I, to stale and segmented during the interwar period, with a large decrease in the number of active breweries, with few to no entries in the business for decades to come, and a trend towards large business groups (Sandberg, 2006; Box, 2017). During this era, marked by cartelization with large competition controls, there was no true national market for beer, but more or less all breweries only operated in their home regions. Gabrielsson (1970) noted a clear concentration phase from 1952 to 1967, but maintained that there were enough movement within the market, in terms of changing market shares, for it to still be termed competitive. By the 1980s then, the entire sector had been almost entirely eradicated, with few breweries remaining, and all but one had been nationalized. This paper quantifies market concentration in the long run, from about 1910 to 1990, which has not been done before, to find its take-off and acceleration. Before 1955, both regional and national market concentration is estimated. To find what was driving the concentration trend, several factors are included, such as cartel policies, state regulations and alcohol policy, the structure of exit rates, and the timing and effect of mergers and acquisitions."

    "text": "This paper proposal is an early draft of my dissertation ‘plan paper’, to be presented at the Political Science Department at Lund University sometime in October/November 2023. The paper will largely form the basis of my dissertation plan and is part of the session “The Neoliberal Shift”.\nThe project sets out to investigate the transformation of the Swedish labor market since the onset of de-industrialization and the rise of neoliberalism. My focus lies on how policy-makers responded to what I will refer to as the ‘underemployment dilemma’. The term underemployment is usually applied in the field of economics to account for the difference between the hours people would like to work and the actual hours worked. The prime example is a part-time worker who is unable to get a full-time position. The understanding of underemployment I depart from is slightly different, referring instead to a structurally induced difficulty to create stable employment; a development that started with de-industrialization. The symptoms of underemployment as opposed to unemployment, however, is not that workers are generally out of work. Underemployment instead takes the expression of insecure, badly paid, bullshit jobs, often in the form of temporary or part-time contracts swallowed by the less productive service sector.\nIn the United States, in which most of the literature on the transformation of labor and its relation to inequality have been conducted, the growth in low-productivity service sector jobs has been significant. Sweden has seen a different trajectory, creating other sorts of restrains on its economy. Already in the 1990s, political economists noted that the shift from manufacturing to services had created new difficulties for policy-makers pursuing full employment and egalitarian wages. The new ‘service economy trilemma’ forced policy-makers to choose only two out of three goals: egalitarian wage-setting, employment growth in the public sector, or budget restraints. Complicating rather than contradicting this story, I want to investigate the multitude and often ‘innovative’ responses to the new low-demand for labor economy in Sweden, moving beyond the alternatives of the above. The primary dilemma, as I see it, is one between a political economic (social democratic) system that works from the ideal of full employment and one in which firms are decreasingly capable of creating that employment. How policy-makers chose to respond to this dilemma is a story that still unfolds, but the early pursuit of neoliberal objectives clearly marked the beginning of it.\nIn short, I take underemployment dilemma to play a significant role in the political economic development of the neoliberal age. Yet, few studies have adopted this perspective as a starting-point for their analysis of neoliberal reform. Political scientists have tended to focus on ideational change among experts, elites, and institutions. Among critical political economists, on the other hand, underemployment is often sweepingly applied to diagnose the current stage of capitalism, but little attention has been paid to the role that it has played in shaping the political economic development. Hence, by tracing rather than assuming the responses to the low-demand economy, I hope to shed new light on the transformation of the Swedish labor market and its intimate relationship to the rise of neoliberalism."

Public and private organisations had to face major challenges, including bankruptcies of businesses and a decline in GDP, triggering structural change. The Pandemic induced considerable organisational and structural change as well as technological renewal, not least digitalisation. Economic sectors that for various reasons could not make use of the new technology were the ones who suffered most. But business organisations seem to have responded differently to the exogenous shock. The purpose of our paper is to find out how business actors perceived and managed the shock, by conducting a case study of Sweden. Our survey is based on three questions. 1) How did the organisations perceive that their operations were affected by the pandemic? 2) What guidance did the organisations use to navigate throughout the crisis? 3) To what extent did the organisations take advantage of the crisis to make changes and strengthen their positions? The answers to these questions come from questionaries and interviews with representatives of organisations in various types of sectors, gathered from the start of the pandemic in Spring 2020 until early 2023."
