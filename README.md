# Conference Website Template

## Purpose

This repo holds a template for a conference website built in quarto.

The intention of this website is to allow a conference to be planned with a single excel spreadsheet.

## Structure

Read here about [quarto websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

## Extensions

I make use of two quarto extensions:

* [embedpdf](https://github.com/jmgirard/embedpdf) from [Jeffrey Girard](https://github.com/jmgirard)
* [fontawesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome) from the [quarto-ext](https://github.com/quarto-ext) team

You can install them with:

* `quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome`
* `quarto add jmgirard/embedpdf`
