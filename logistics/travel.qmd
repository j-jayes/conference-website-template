## Replacement busses between Malmö C and Lund

Due to track maintenance, the trains between Lund and Malmö are cancelled during the week of the meeting. There are rail replacement buses between Malmö C and Lund.

You can [read about the disruption on the skanetrafiken website](https://www.skanetrafiken.se/banarbeten1/malmolund-22-september2-oktober3/#/).

When arriving in Malmö from Copenhagen, you can take the replacement bus from the stop at P on the map below. Stop P is North of the station and across two roads. There will be signage. Feel free to ask for guidance on +46 771 77 77 77.
