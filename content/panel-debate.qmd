🎙️🔥Get ready for a heated debate that will set the stage on fire at the 15th Swedish Economic History Meeting!🔥🎙️

Join us in Lund on the 27th of September as we host an electrifying panel debate between two of Sweden's most distinguished journalists, who will clash head-on to discuss the burning issues surrounding social mobility and equal opportunities in our society.

📚Introducing Petter Larsson, the fierce socialist and author of the provocative book "Riggat", who will take the stage to challenge the notion that Sweden is a bastion of social mobility and equal opportunities.

🖋️Facing him, we have Sofia Nerbrand, the brilliant political editor of Kristiantadsbladet and former editor-in-chief of the liberal magazine Neo, who will bring her vast experience and sharp insights to defend her position.

⌚️Don't miss this epic showdown! The debate will take place from 1600 to 1700 at EC1, Holger Crafoords Ekonomicentrum, Tycho Brahes väg 1, 223 63 Lund.

🥂And the excitement doesn't end there! After the debate, join us for a reception in Ljusgården at Holger Crafoords Ekonomicentrum, where you can mingle with the panelists and fellow attendees, discuss the insights from the debate, and enjoy a memorable evening.
